Final Diagnosis
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis.  Negative for malignancy.

B.  Rectum, resection:  Microscopic residual moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is identified as scattered cell clusters and glands involving the submucosa and inner layer of the muscularis propria within a 0.3 cm diameter treatment associated and predominantly-healed ulcer, located 1.1 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 2.1 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple (2) minute regional lymph nodes are negative for malignancy and do not reveal treatment associated changes. AJCC ypT2N0M1

C.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Without diagnostic abnormality.  Negative for malignancy.

D.  Liver, right lobe, right hepatectomy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary is identified as multiple (6) foci, 0.3 to 2.0 cm in diameter, completely excised.

E.  Liver, portions segment #2, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary is identified as two separate nodules, 1.8 to 2.2 cm in diameter, completely excised.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is an 8.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  No stones are present within the lumen.  Cholesterolosis is focally identified.  No masses are identified. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by STEWART.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is a 37.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 0.3 x 0.3 cm healed ulcer located 1.1 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 2.1 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by INNISS

C.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid colon"" is a 7.5 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with unremarkable mucosa.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by AML.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""right lobe of liver"" is a 990.0 gram, 17.0 x 15.0 x 7.0 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  There  are multiple (6) masses (ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension) which are 0.6 cm from the closest resection margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SHARP

E.  Received fresh labeled ""portions segment #2 of liver"" is a 4.3 gram,  3.2 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm  partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm mass is present 0.3 cm from the surgical margin.  Also received is a second 4.6 gram 3.3 x 3.2 x 1.4 cm  partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm mass is present 0.4 cm from the surgical margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SOLIS.





Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Sam J. Schmidt, M.D.

B.  Rectum, resection:  Microscopic residual adenocarcinoma involving the muscularis propria.  Hold over to confirm.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Dale J. Arnett, M.D.

C.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Without diagnostic abnormality.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Dale J. Arnett, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
Due to the patient's young age, reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC will be performed on metastatic adenocarcinoma in the right lobe of liver consistent with colorectal primary (block D4).  When completed, results will be available in GNYD ZoznKyzy (molecular genetics report).
