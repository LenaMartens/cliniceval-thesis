#1 Right colon cancer
Our plan is to proceed with a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy to remove the disease and better stage it.  The indication and risks of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient.  Included in the discussion were the possibility of not being able to do this laparoscopically and needing a larger incision.  We also discussed the risk of a right colectomy in regard to anastomotic leak and possible treatment for such which included possible emergency surgery and ileostomy.  We also discussed the possible risks of needing blood, and the patient agreed to a blood transfusion if needed.  Other risks discussed with the patient included wound infections, urinary tract infections, difficulty in placing the catheter, possible worsening of his stress incontinence related to the urinary catheter, as well as possible pneumonia.  We discussed possible acute cardiopulmonary events including blood clots and cardiac events that would require resuscitation, and the patient wishes to be fully resuscitated.  After all this discussion, the patient was listed for surgery on Thursday.  He was site marked.  Consent form was signed.

This is a 65-year-old gentleman who was undergoing screening colonoscopy and was found to have a right-sided lesion consistent with colon cancer on biopsy.  Staging has been performed and does not show any evidence of widely metastatic disease or even local regional disease as far as we can tell.  The patient's past surgical history is notable for having a prostatectomy as well as a penile implant.  He is otherwise a very healthy gentleman.  No significant other medical problems.
