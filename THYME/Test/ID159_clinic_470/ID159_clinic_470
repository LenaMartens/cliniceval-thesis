#1 Resected lymph node-positive recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Harvey service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Moreau, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Dr. Moreau will visit with Mr. Kraatz for postoperative recommendations.  At this point, we will not make follow-up appointments, but if the need arises in the future, we will be more than happy to help facilitate care.  He will followup locally with his medical oncologist.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

I was asked by Dr. Harvey service to visit with Mr. Kraatz for postoperative education purposes.
1. Mr. Kraatz was originally diagnosed with an early-stage rectal cancer in 2002.  At that time, he went through a transanal excision.
2. He then had a subsequent recurrence of his rectal cancer discovered on a surveillance colonoscopy in 2007.   3. He received chemotherapy (FOLFOX) and radiation through November 2007 and then proceeded to resection of the area of recurrent disease on April 8, 2008.
4. Postoperatively, Mr. Kraatz received a course of therapy with Xeloda.
5. He started to complain of rectal bleeding in February 2010. He was found to have a recurrent disease that was locally invading the pelvic wall. Biopsies of the lesion as well as the pelvic wall were positive for metastatic cancer.
6. He was started on capecitabine and bevacizumab that was stopped after a short course.
7. In the interim, the patient presented to local emergency room with what appeared to be superior vena cava syndrome.  The patient was treated with TPA followed by heparin and then oral Coumadin.
8. The patient received two cycles of FOLFIRI through his local oncologist.
9. July through August 2010 - received concurrent Xeloda with radiation therapy, overall tolerated well.
10.  August 4, 2010 - underwent surgical resection by Drs. Orcutt, Charlie Bourgeois, and Charlie Felder.  Surgery involved bilateral ureteral stent placement, intraoperative radiation therapy with high-dose brachytherapy, pedicled omental flap placement, complex resection of the pelvic tumor with completion proctectomy, resection of a pyriformis tumor, left iliac nodal dissection, resection of small-bowel, right colon, appendix, and terminal ileum, creation of an ileo-ascending colostomy, decompression of the small-bowel for release of small-bowel obstruction, and a radical resection of mesenteric lymph nodes.  Surgical pathology demonstrated 8 of 18 lymph nodes within the mesenteric ileum positive for metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma with a rectal primary as well as 1 of 5 left iliac lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Small-bowel resection noted 6 of 7 regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The excision of the top of the rectum showed a 5.4-cm x 3.2-cm x 3.0-cm mass with grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria into the perirectal fat.  Pelvic tumor excision was also involved by grade 4 (of 4) rectal adenocarcinoma.  The rectal and anus resection involved grade 4 (of 4) rectal adenocarcinoma forming a 5.2-cm x 3.6-cm x 2.0-cm ulcerated mass at the dentate line invading through the muscularis propria into the perirectal fat.  There were negative margins.  The proximal rectal tumor forming a 3.2-cm x 2.2-cm x 1.4-cm mass was also involved by grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma invading to the muscularis propria.  The pelvic tumor excision was also involved by rectal adenocarcinoma.  No gross disease was left behind.
Mr. Kraatz is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in a chair during our consultation today.
