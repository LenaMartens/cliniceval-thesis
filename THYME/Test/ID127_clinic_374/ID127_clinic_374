#1 Resected recurrent sigmoid colon cancer, node-negative
Prior to meeting with Mrs. Walton and her family, I have had the opportunity to review her past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  At this time, her CT-scan was from home and per quick evaluation did not appear to have any areas of concern.  I will have formal evaluation performed by our colleagues in Radiology and contact patient back regarding this issue.  In regard to further chemotherapy, I have informed Mrs. Walton that there is no right or wrong answer in this situation and that at times observation is what is elected.  This is what the patient is desiring.  It has been quite some time since her surgery and therefore any benefit from adjuvant therapy would be unknown.  Therefore recommending continued observation which would include laboratory tests every three-months with repeat imaging studies at least yearly.  Did inform her that I would more than likely have a CT-scan obtained every six-months.  She will contact her primary oncologist to have the oncologist manage her care.
#2 Urinary stents
At this time, feel that removing the urinary stents would be appropriate.  I did speak with Urology, and they are recommending that approximately four to six-weeks after removal of the urinary stents, then an EXU be performed to determine if there is any evidence of hydronephrosis.  Would be concerned that she may have a stricture from her past radiation exposure.  Oftentimes this can be asymptomatic.  Did counsel patient regarding this issue, and she will followup with her primary-care provider.  If an EXU is not possible, a CT urogram would be the next recommendation.
#3 Followup
At this time, patient is going to continue being followed by her primary oncologist.  She understands that she certainly can contact us at any time should she have any further questions or concerns.  She has our telephone number to contact us.

Mrs. Walton is a pleasant 72-year-old woman from Tempe.  I am seeing her today after her surgical resection of her recurrent sigmoid colon cancer.  For comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated March 1, 2010.  Briefly, her oncology history is as follows:
1.  September 11, 2008, due to anemia underwent a colonoscopy which noted a constricting distal sigmoid cancer.  Biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.
2.  September 29, 2008, low-anterior resection.  Pathology positive for moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon.  Nine lymph nodes removed and all negative (T3, N0).
3.  December 1, 2008, patient opted to forgo chemotherapy and continue with observation only.  PET/CT at that time noted a small focus of increased activity in the posterior aspect of the pelvis.  Subsequent CT scans in March of 2009 and September 9, 2009, negative.
4.  November 11, 2009, colonoscopy noted three sutures at the anastomotic site.  Biopsy of the tissue that had overgrown one of the sutures was positive for fragments of tubular adenoma.  Adjacent polypoid granulation tissue.  Negative for high-grade malignancy.  Tissue from the ascending colon--sessile, serrated adenoma.
6.  November 17, 2009, severe abdominal pain.  CT-scan noted a new lesion in the pelvis measuring 3.4 cm abutting the vaginal cuff and serosal surface of the small-bowel loops.
7.  December 3, 2009, biopsy of pelvic mass positive for moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  K-ras noted mutation.
8.  December 30, 2009, through February 24, 2010, five treatments of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Dose modification due to fatigue and decreased counts.  Subsequent CT scans documented response to the present treatment.
9.  March 15 through April 16, 2010, initiated combined chemoradiation therapy, receiving infusional 5-FU with infusional 5-FU discontinued approximately four days before the end of radiation therapy.  This was done due to fatigue.  April 5, 2010, transfused with 2 units of red blood cells for a hemoglobin in the 8 range.  Postradiation, did require IV fluid support while in the hospital for approximately two-weeks.
10. May 27, 2010 - Dr. Nash, Dr. Peters, and Dr. Rivera, all performed surgery including a bilateral uretal stent placement with a preoperative cystoscopy, resection of two portions of the small-bowel with primary anastomosis with an en bloc resection of the colorectal anastomosis, and the posterior wall of the vagina, mobilization of the bladder and ureters, radical upper vaginectomy, and omentoplasty.  Pathology of the terminal ileum resection is intestinal serosa and muscularis propria that are involved by a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary.  The rectosigmoid anastomosis is also involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic primary.  Of 21 regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for metastatic disease.  Remaining tissue removed was negative for disease.
Today, Mrs. Walton has returned being it is three-months since her surgery.  At that time, it was recommended that she have her urinary stents removed.  I had been contacted by the urologist who is preparing to do so, who was questioning whether we would want stents exchanged or indeed want them removed.  At that time, recommended that patient be evaluated by myself before proceeding.  Therefore, she is presenting here today.
Mrs. Walton states that she feels extremely well.  Reports that her appetite has been very good.  Weight has been stable.  Energy level is improving.  Reports that her bowels have been moving normally, denying any blood or mucus.  She does have one little sore on her stoma site for which she was evaluated by our colleagues in the Stomal Department.  Reports that her urination has been normal.  Denies any pain, strong odor, or frequency.  Denies elevated temperature, night sweats, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or lower-extremity edema.
