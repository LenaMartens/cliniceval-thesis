#1 Resected stage III sigmoid adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Collins's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Coughlin, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
Mr. Freese indicates that he will probably receive all of his treatment here.  He would like me to preschedule port-a-cath placement and potential chemotherapy which I will do for him.  He will let me know the date he wishes to return and I will move forward with appointments.  I will also order a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, postoperative evaluation with Dr. Collins, port-a-cath consultation by our colleagues in General Surgery and a formal consultation by Norwood Care Center.

I have been asked by Dr. Collins's Service to visit with Mr. Freese for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Freese is a pleasant 70-year-old from Washington.
1. January 2010 developed bright-red blood per rectum.
2. January 7, 2010, colonoscopy performed showing a tumor approximately 3-cm in length in the sigmoid.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis and chest x-ray were both negative.  CEA 10.
3. January 26, 2010, referred to the Hudson, seen by Dr. Collins and underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy.  Per operative note, no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.4 x 3.6 x 1.2-cm mass invading through the muscularis propria to the serosal surface involving 6 of 23 regional lymph nodes, negative surgical margins, no evidence of distant metastasis staged at T4a, N2, M0 resected sigmoid adenocarcinoma.
I met Mr. Freese who is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in a chair during our consultation today.
