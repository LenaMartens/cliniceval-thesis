Ms. Cornelius is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple polyps. A colonoscopy on May 13, 2010 revealed no evidence of a residual polyp at the hepatic flexure, but within the transverse colon, there was a broad-based sessile polyp approximately 1.5-cm in diameter.  Biopsies with pathology shows  invasive grade 3 (of 4)  adenocarcinoma, arising in tubular adenoma with high-grade  dysplasia.  The carcinoma extends to the deep margin.  A CT-scan on May 20, 2010  shows no  evidence of recurrent or metastatic colon carcinoma. She comes now for surgical management of this colon cancer.
