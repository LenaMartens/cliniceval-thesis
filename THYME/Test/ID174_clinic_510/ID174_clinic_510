Mr. Bailey is a 31-year-old gentleman who was recently found to have sigmoid colon cancer. He underwent a colonoscopy because he was having bleeding and increased stool frequency. This showed a 4- to 5-mass 25 cm from the anal verge.  This was biopsied and tattooed.  In addition, a pedunculated 1.25-cm mass was removed from the proximal descending colon 50 cm from the anal verge.  Also, a 2-mm polyp on a thick stalk removed from sigmoid colon 30 cm from the anal verge, and 4, 2-mm polyps removed from the distal rectum and proximal rectum.  Pathology from outside states the mass at 25 cm was an adenocarcinoma moderately differentiated; polyp at 50 cm was a tubular adenoma; polyp at 30 cm, a tubular adenoma; and the rectal polyps, inflammatory polyps.  A CT abdomen and pelvis 12 May 2010 showed a 4.3-cm sigmoid colon mass and no evidence of abdominal or pelvic metastatic disease and fatty infiltration of the liver.  He comes now for surgical management of this colon cancer.
