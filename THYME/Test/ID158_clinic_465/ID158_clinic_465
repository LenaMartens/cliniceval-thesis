Reviewed outside colonoscopy, pathology, and radiology reports.
#1 Rectosigmoid cancer
Mr. Quinn presents for evaluation and treatment of rectosigmoid cancer, described 12 to 15-cm above the anal verge on outside exam.  I discussed the development, staging, and treatment of rectosigmoid cancer with the patient and his family members, including the need to discern whether this is truly rectal or more sigmoid, as this would affect rationale for neoadjuvant chemoradiation consideration if T3 or N1 disease is noted, versus consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy as this is more sigmoid and involves lymph nodes.  I have requested tattoo of the distal margin, and he is agreeable to proceeding with immunohistochemistry staining to assess for Lynch syndrome.  Also, one could consider polyposis given his father's history, and therefore we will obtain an extended EGD with sideviewer at the time of his colonoscopy.  Certainly, if duodenal polyps or even cystic fundic gland polyps are identified on EGD, this would be more suggestive of a polyposis syndrome.
I also discussed the role for a colonic stent with the patient, but given the need for therapy in the near future, we at this time will not proceed with that.  Instead, we will make diet recommendations to avoid bulk and utilize a stool softener.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, the patient is okay for anesthesia.
Discussed with Dr. Lawrence Ashworth, note to follow.

Mr. Quinn is a 46-year-old gentleman who presents to Parkway Regional Center for evaluation and treatment of rectal cancer.  Mr. Quinn developed rectal bleeding and underwent his first colonoscopy April 15, 2010.  A small polyp was removed from the sigmoid at 70 cm (tubular adenoma, low-grade dysplasia) and a partially obstructing mass was noted in the rectosigmoid extending from 12 to 15-cm above the anal verge.  Biopsies demonstrated invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma, and SMHWC Pathology confirms the diagnosis.  CT abdomen and pelvis of April 15, 2010, was negative for metastatic disease.  A-1.5-cm cyst was noted in the liver, and a 2-mm right pulmonary nodule was noted.  CEA was 2.  Mr. Quinn is symptomatic with persistent bright-red blood per rectum, increased fragmentation of stools, and also has had fevers and chills periodically for several weeks.  He has lost 20 pounds over the past couple of months.  Prior to the onset of GI symptoms, his baseline bowel pattern was two-to-three stools per day with no incontinence or urgency.
Comorbidities include nicotine dependence (chews tobacco) and hyperlipidemia.  He had cardiac ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.  He currently is without any cardiopulmonary complaints.
