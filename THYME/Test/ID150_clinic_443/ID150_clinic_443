#1 Stage IIIB (T2, N2a, M0) adenocarcinoma of the rectum, status-post APR
We had a fairly extensive discussion today with Mr. Klassen and his family with regard to our followup recommendations for his recently resected rectal cancer.  The patient is currently doing well postoperatively from his resection.  We discussed that his first goal is to recover from the surgery.  We would then like to see him back in GI Clinic in about four to six-weeks' time.  When we see him in clinic, we will discuss options such as chemotherapy and radiation adjuvant treatments.  The patient has already visited with the Radiation Oncology Team as well here in the hospital.  We will coordinate our plan with them at that time.  We will need to see how the patient's performance status is at that time as well when formulating his adjuvant plan.  I answered several of the patient's and his family's questions; however, we will address things in more detail at that postoperative followup appointment in four to six-weeks.
Thank-you for allowing us to consult on Mr. Klassen's care.  Please do not hesitate to call us with any questions.  Our pager is 269-675-15216.

Mr. Klassen is a very pleasant 75-year-old male from APO New York, New York whose oncologic history is as follows:
1.  March 16, 2010, the patient underwent a colonoscopy for screening.  Three lesions were noted with two of them being polyps with low-grade dysplasia and the third one being approximately 3-cm in the distal rectum near the dentate that initially, on outside pathology, was indeterminate for adenocarcinoma but review here at Camelot Medical Center showed invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.
2.  April 21, 2010, the patient was evaluated by the GI Team here at Camelot Medical Center.  A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a few very minimally prominent perirectal lymph nodes.  A CEA checked at that time was 1.4.
3.  April 22, 2010, a rectal endoscopic ultrasound and FNA were completed.  On the EUS, the tumor appeared as a T2 tumor invading into the muscularis propria and also into the proximal portion of the sphincter.  The nodal appearance on EUS also appeared as an N1.  The FNA of the sample lymph node, however, was negative.
4.  April 30, 2010, Dr. Gilbert completed a laparoscopic APR which had to be converted to an open procedure due to anatomical reasons.  The pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1-cm and noted to be invading into the muscularis propria.  The margins were negative, and 4 of the 27 sampled lymph nodes were positive.  Four tumor deposits were noted in the perirectal adipose tissue.  The patient was thus staged as a T2, N2a, M0, stage IIIB rectal cancer.
We were asked to consult on Mr. Klassen's followup care due to his recently resected rectal cancer.  The patient is currently recovering from his surgery and overall doing well.  He has minimal to no complaints today.  He continues to have an NG tube in place.  He says his pain is overall controlled.  Otherwise, he denies any fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness-of-breath.
