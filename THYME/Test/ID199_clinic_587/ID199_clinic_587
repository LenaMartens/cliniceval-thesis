#1 Stage I (pT1, N0, M0) rectal cancer
Ms. Hogan has had a very early-stage rectal cancer resected.  I reviewed the findings on pathology with her and her partner today and reassured her that given this early-stage disease, her outcome would be expected to be very good after surgical resection, and that there is no need for adjuvant therapy in this setting.  Ms. Hogan and her partner expressed understanding, and she is planning to undergo takedown of her ostomy on November 11.
As far as surveillance, I think that her risk is low enough that we can see her every four to six-months with a history, physical exam, and perhaps a CEA.  We may perform further imaging in the form of a CT-scan on a yearly-or-so basis, both for surveillance but as well to ensure the stability of the superior mediastinal mass which raises the possibility of thymoma.
All of this was discussed with Ms. Hogan and her partner, and they expressed understanding.  I will see her back in four to six-months with a history, physical, and CEA.
I have discussed this case at length with Dr. Davis, my supervising oncologist for the day, who was essential in the formation of the assessment and plan.

Ms. Hogan is a very pleasant 49-year-old female with the following oncologic history (for further diagnostic details, please see my note dated August 5, 2010):
1.  July 2010, screening colonoscopy reveals a concerning mass 15-cm from the anal verge.  Biopsy is consistent with intramucosal adenocarcinoma.  Patient is asymptomatic at this time.
2.  August  2010, Mr. Hogan referred to Ankeny County Memorial Hospital for further evaluation.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy reveals obvious mass concerning for malignancy and further staging including an EUS reveals T1, N0 rectal cancer and no evidence of distant disease on imaging including a chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT-scan.
3.  August 24, 2010, Dr. Depriest performs a low-anterior resection with temporary diverting ileostomy.  Pathology review reveals a 1.5- x 1.5- x 0.6-cm ulcerated mass composed of mildly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Margins were negative, and 19 regional lymph nodes were also negative making this a (pT1, N0, M0) rectal cancer.
Ms. Hogan returns to clinic today in the postoperative setting.  Her postoperative course was complicated by wound dehiscence and infection for which she is on antibiotics and packing the wound.  This has been the major limiting step in her recovery, and she states that her ostomy is functioning well.  She frankly denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting at this time.
