#1 Sigmoid adenocarcinoma, grade 3 of 4, pT3, N0, M0, status-post sigmoid resection and multiple (16) lymph node dissection with negative surgical margins
At this time, there are no clear high-risk features other than a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and a T3 lesion.  The surgical margins are negative.  There is no evidence of nodal involvement and multiple (16) lymph nodes were included in the specimen and all were negative for malignancy.  Based on these findings and multiple comorbid conditions, we discussed about the controversial role of chemotherapy in this setting.  Clearly, he does not appear to be a candidate for any adjuvant chemotherapy based on his tumor characteristics and overall medical conditions.  He would require periodic followup with three-monthly checkup of CEA levels, and his next CT-scan should be performed in six-months.  He should undergo colonoscopy one-year from the diagnosis of his colon cancer (January 2011).  I would ask him to continue on iron pills.  Clearly, there is evidence of iron-deficiency anemia, but there is an improvement in his hemoglobin.
I suggested that he be evaluated by our cardiologists for possible anticoagulation and optimization of his cardiac medications due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy along with atrial fibrillation.  At this time, he does not wish to be on Coumadin, and he understands the risks including that of stroke if he is not on chronic anticoagulation.  He does not wish to follow-up with cardiologists for now.  He has multiple medical issues including diabetic neuropathy for which he is currently receiving Neurontin and has been following-up with a diabetologist closer to home.  At this point, I would not get a KRAS testing done; however, in the future if there is a need, we could always get it.  Currently, we are not recommending any form of adjuvant therapy.  I indicated that his siblings/children/first-degree relatives should undergo colonoscopic evaluation at the age of 50.

Mr. Robinson is a very pleasant 72-year-old gentleman with the following oncologic history.
1.  January 27, 2010 - First ever colonoscopy to the cecum performed due to anemia.  A mass was located 35 cm from the anal verge.  This was biopsy positive for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with evidence of invasion.
2.  February 23, 2010 - Underwent heart catheterization, do not have those reports.
3.  April 27, 2010 - Presented to Edgerton Womens Center New York Foundling Hospital for further evaluation.  CT abdomen and pelvis negative for colonic mass or liver metastasis.
4.  April 29, 2010 - Echocardiogram noting severe left ventricular enlargement with an ejection fraction at 26%.  Akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral walls of the left ventricle.  Trivial mitral valve regurg with severe left atrial enlargement.  Mildly enlarged right ventricle.  Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation and severe right atrial enlargement.
5.  May 12, 2010 - Dr. Otoole performed a sigmoid resection.  Per operative report, there was no evidence of any metastatic disease within the abdomen.  Pathology of the sigmoid tissue positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat.  Negative surgical margins.  (12) diverticular identified.  Of 16 regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for malignancy (pT3, N0).
Today, he comes to discuss the adjuvant chemotherapy.  Notably, he has multiple medical comorbidities including severe CHF and coronary artery disease with several MIs in the past.  He denies any chest pain.  He states his shortness-of-breath is at its baseline.  He denies any recent unintentional weight-loss.  He denies nausea, vomiting.  He states that occasionally he gets constipated with iron pills, and at times with use of laxatives he gets loose bowel movements.  He denies any rectal bleeding.  He does state that his stools are black since initiation of iron.  He denies any bone pain or headache.  He denies any cough.

Head:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.Thyroid:  Neck supple.Lymph:  No lymphadenopathy noted.Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.Reports:  Labs--hemoglobin 10.8, was 9.7 on May 13.  Leukocyte count 6.3.  Platelets 227.  Creatinine is 1.1.  CEA is 1.3.  I do not see any preoperative CEA levels.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis does not show any evidence of metastatic disease.  There are renal calculi and bladder calculus noted.  There is a tiny low-attenuation lesion in the left hepatic lobe which is likely a cyst and was present but less well-visualized on the prior CT-scan of April 27, 2010.  In addition, there is evidence of cholelithiasis and severe atherosclerosis.Mental:  Alert and oriented times three.Abdomen:  Soft, obese, nontender.  I could not appreciate any organomegaly.  Surgical incision healing well.Eyes:  Nonicteric.
