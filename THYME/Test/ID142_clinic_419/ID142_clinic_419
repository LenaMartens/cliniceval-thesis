#1 Resected, metastatic rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma to the liver, KRAS-mutant
I have reviewed all of the above in-depth with Mr. Keen as well as his significant otherwise and Dr. Botello.  At this point, fortunately, Mr. Keen has had a complete surgical resection of his primary mass in his rectum as well as his liver metastasis.  There does not appear on imaging or blood work to be any evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease at this point.  Mr. Keen understands he is at high-risk for recurrence, and therefore we are recommending an additional course of chemotherapy.  As he has had such a good response to FOLFOX with overall good tolerance, we have recommended an additional four to six cycles with dose adjustments as cycles continue, based on tolerance to oxaliplatin.  He plans on getting this treatment at-home locally in Sutherlin, which is acceptable.
We would recommend that Mr. Keen return after he completes his chemotherapy and has an interval month off for consideration by Dr. Zamora for reversal of his ileostomy.  He knows to call at any time if there are problems or concerns.
#2 Port-A-Cath-associated right arm DVT
Mr. Keen has had a Port-A-Cath-associated DVT and subsequently had that Port-A-Cath removed.  He is scheduled to see our surgeons tomorrow for consideration of a new Port-A-Cath, which he will need for chemotherapy.  From my perspective, he would be medically acceptable for this planned procedure.  He is on blood thinners due to his prior Port-A-Cath-associated blood clot, and I have asked him to take half the dose of his Fragmin the night before, omit Fragmin in the morning of his procedure, and then he can restart his Fragmin that evening.  He will eventually transition to Coumadin, but he will do this locally with his home medical provider.

Mr. Keen is a pleasant 57-year-old male from Richmond 02195.
1.  March 2010:  Presented with a three- to four-month history of bright-red blood per rectum.
2.  March 8, 2010:  Colonoscopy was performed showing a rectosigmoid mass at 15-cm.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  March 8, 2010:  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis identifying liver metastasis, the largest 1.9-cm in size, as well as rectosigmoid mass.  Chest x-ray negative.  PET scan showing increased FDG uptake in the liver metastasis.  CEA 28.2.
4.  April 2010:  Evaluated by Dr. Gamache of Medical Oncology, Dr. Bennett of General Surgery, and Dr. Zamora of Colorectal Surgery with the joint consensus to receive systemic chemotherapy and reevaluation for hopeful surgical resection.
5.  April 2010:  Port-A-Cath placed at an outside institution.
6.  April 2010 to June 30, 2010:  Received systemic FOLFOX.  Overall tolerated well.  Did have Port-A-Cath "flip" in approximately May 2010 but continued chemotherapy through the Port-A-Cath, although did have extensive associated pain down his arm.  Overall tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well.
7.  July 7, 2010:  Returned for evaluation including CT imaging showing decreased hepatic metastasis as well as decreased primary rectal tumor with no new disease.  Patient complained of Port-A-Cath-associated arm pain and swelling.
8.  July 7, 2010:  Doppler ultrasound performed of the right upper quadrant positive for DVT.  Large Port-A-Cath-associated vein occluding the right subclavian vein, the right axillary vein, as well as collateral venous veins.  Hospitalized, appropriately anticoagulated with Fragmin.  Evaluated while hospitalized by Thrombophilia.  Deemed appropriate to proceed with planned surgical resection if patient maintained Fragmin use.  Appropriate instructions including taking half of Fragmin dose the day before surgery and omitting the dose on the day of surgery.  No need for SVC filter.  Coagulation was thought to be at least 12 weeks.  Port-A-Cath removed.
9.  July 20, 2010:  Taken for a joint resection by Dr. Bennett and Dr. Zamora with resection of liver masses from segments II, VI, and VIII as well as a diverting loop ileostomy with rectal resection and intraoperative radiofrequency ablation of liver segment VIII times one.  Surgical pathology identified a 3.4- x 1.7- x 1.3-cm mass in the rectum invading through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat with focal treatment-associated changes.  Negative surgical margins; 5 (of 24) regional lymph nodes positive.  Also liver segment VI, consistent with 1.4- x 1.3- x 1.2-cm metastatic adenocarcinoma with negative margins and a 0.5- x 0.4- x 0.2-cm mass, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, and a 0.7- x 0.6- x 0.8-cm nodule as well as a 0.5- x 0.4- x 0.3-cm mass--all consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with negative surgical margins.
10.  August 23, 2010:  Evaluated by in Medical Oncology, recommended additional FOLFOX for four to six more cycles, depending on oxaliplatin tolerance.
Mr. Keen returns to Medical Oncology for ongoing management and care.  In the interval month, he has had time to recover from surgery and overall feels well.  His ileostomy is functioning without appreciable problems, but he does have some soreness around his ostomy site.  He mostly has liquid bowel movements but has not tried the Metamucil or Imodium that has been prescribed.  He has had no blood or mucus.  His appetite is good, and he is able to regain some weight.  He has had no fevers or night sweats.  He has no abdominal pain, epigastric pain, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.  He has no nausea or vomiting.  He has had no dysuria.  He has a good energy level that is improving daily.
