Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified arising in a tubulovillous adenoma and forming an ulcerative, annular mass (7.5 x 4.5 x 2.7 cm) located in the cecum, 4.0 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not definitively identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (7 of 12) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Extranodal extension is identified. [AJCC pT3N2M1]

B.  Liver, right lobe, wedge resection:  Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma is identified forming a mass (0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm).  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.6 cm).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
