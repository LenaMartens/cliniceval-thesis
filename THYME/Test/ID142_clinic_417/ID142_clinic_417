#1 Newly-diagnosed rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis
Mr. Keen is a pleasant 56-year-old male from Richmond 02195, with newly-diagnosed rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis seeking treatment and recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Ashley Gamache through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent supervisory note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mr. Keen returns to Medical Oncology today to discuss treatment options for his newly-diagnosed metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma to the liver.  Presently, overall, he is having progressive symptoms in his bowel habits.  He notes he is having smaller and less frequent bowel movements over the last month.  They are thinner, and there is more blood associated with them.  He also has rectal "pressure."  It is not painful, but he finds it difficult to stay sitting for much time.  He has occasional left lower quadrant abdominal discomfort which is mild. He has no other abdominal pain.  He has a good appetite and has maintained his weight.  He has mild nausea with no vomiting on occasion.  He has no fevers or night sweats.  Overall, his energy level is lower.  He does nap, but he still is very active.  He has no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.
