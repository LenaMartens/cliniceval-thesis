Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Reid Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Brewer, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
PATIENT EDUCATION:
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mrs. Leonardo is a pleasant 66-year-old woman from Washington.  I am seeing her today at the request of Dr. Reid Surgical Service to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a ruptured rectal adenocarcinoma that is node-positive.  Mrs. Leonardo's history is as follows.
1.  February 2010 presented to her local provider with right-sided buttocks pain, rectal bleeding unable to control and a 20-pound weight-loss since November 2009.  CT-scan performed at the home facility notes air within the right buttocks, thigh, labia and perirectal region.
2.  February 4, 2010, transferred to Atlantic Shores Hospital where she underwent incision and drainage of this area.  Biopsy of the tissue was positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.
3.  February 5, 2010, repeat CT-scan continuing to document air within the same region.  Also noted circumferential wall thickening of the distal rectum and anus.  There is a soft-tissue mass in the posterior wall of the distal rectum.  Multiple prominent perirectal lymph nodes questioning infectious etiology versus neoplastic.  Small lucent lesion at T11 and L2 too small to characterize.
4.  February 6, 2010, in the operating room underwent a laparoscopic sigmoid loop colostomy and debridement of the right ischiorectal fossa abscess.
5.  February 9, 2010, attempt at colonoscopy which was unsuccessful due to poor prep.  CT-scan performed at that time noting a decrease in the perirectal fluid/air collection as well as the right perineum.  There was stable thickening of the rectum/anus.  Also stable was a mass at the posterior rectal wall, lymph nodes throughout the gastrohepatic, porta hepatis, para-aortic region.  Stable lesion in T11, 12, L2 and L3 with some of these appearing to be hemangiomas and the others indeterminate.  Also noting an insufficiency fracture in the bilateral anterior sacral ala.
6.  February 10, 2010, Dr. Holloway performed an abdominal perineal resection and the operative report is not available at this time.  All of the consultation was performed off the pathology results which read from the abdominal perineal resection, moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated mass located in the rectum.  The posterior radial margin is positive for adenocarcinoma.  Nine of 38 regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  It looks like additional margins were obtained with some being positive for adenocarcinoma, others being negative (pT3, N2).
Today, Mrs. Leonardo is one-day postoperative.  She is alert, oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  Her daughter is also present during this consultation.
