31-Mar-2010 15:28:00  Exam: NMPET/CT trunk    ORIGINAL REPORT - 31-Mar-2010 15:49:00   Harvest Morningside Memorial Hospital
F-18 FDG PET/CT-scan was performed from the orbits through the upper thighs with CT fusion imaging for attenuation correction and anatomic coregistration only. Urinary drainage catheter was in place. Clinical Indication: Probable rectal cancer. Initial treatment strategy.
Impression: Probable localized rectal cancer without evidence for metastasis.
Findings: Hypermetabolism is seen in the rectum corresponding to increased soft-tissue in the region that is consistent with malignancy. Mild metabolic activity at the anal verge is seen which is probably inflammatory. No hypermetabolic local adenopathy is identified. Normal activity is seen in the abdomen otherwise. Normal
metabolism in the liver. No abnormalities of concern in the chest or neck. Probable arthritis in the left AC joint. Significant incidental findings on the low-dose unenhanced CT fusion images. Bilateral maxillary sinus opacities.

46-yr-old male with history of at least ten years of anal canal pain and outlet bleeding, presumably secondary to a chronic anal fissure. The rectal pain changed in last few months and became deeper and was associated with constipation. An outside colonoscopy in March 2010 demonstrated a circumferential, nonobstructing lesion in the low to mid rectum.  The colon proximal to this lesion was reportedly normal. Biopsies of the rectal mass revealed focal high-grade dysplasia with desmoplastic stroma suspicious for at least a mucosal carcinoma. Outside CT-scan shows no definite evidence of metastatic disease.
In addition the patient has had a 40 lb. weight-loss sine 2008 attributed to symptoms thought to represent Guillain-Barre-like illness.
He came to PH for further evaluation. PH EUS dated 4/2/2010, demonstrated T2 lesion and in the region of the tumor, two diminutive 5 x 3 round hypoechoic lymph nodes were noted that were adjacent to the tumor. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Because of the location of the tumor, its size, the fact that it looked like a T2, N1 on ultrasound, a recommendation for preoperative chemoradiation was made. He went on to complete a course of preoperative chemoradiation on 6/11/10. He comes to the hospital for surgical management at this time.
