Mr. Wheeler suffers from a metastatic cecal cancer, KRAS mutated.  We obtained new CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis here unfortunately without contrast.  As before, the patient has small, likely nonmalignant intrapulmonary nodules which I would not be too concerned about in particular since they have been stable over the last year and did not take up any PET tracer.  In the noncontrast-enhanced scans of the liver, we do see some focal abnormalities which likely correspond to the lesions previously identified by PET scan in October of 2009.  I have reviewed these findings with Mr. Wheeler and his wife.  Patient is scheduled to meet with Dr. Lindsey later today, and it is considered very likely that he will take the patient to surgery.  During surgery, a liver ultrasound will be performed to further clarify the situation with regard to the actual location of the intrahepatic lesions.  I will try to obtain an MRI of the liver before the patient sees Dr. Lindsey to be able to visualize the intrahepatic lesions with a technology which does not require the administration of iodine contrast.
I reviewed with Mr. Wheeler that the overall goal of therapy is curative at this point in time.  He has responded to chemotherapy with a tumor marker decrease and a PET response.  This provides the rationale to continue postoperative chemotherapy with the same regimen, meaning FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab.  Patient will pursue further oncologic care with his primary oncologist, Dr. Fenimore, in Indianapolis.
From my side, the patient is cleared for surgery.  He is now six-weeks from his last bevacizumab administration, so I would not see any problems if he went to surgery within the next couple of days.

Mr. Wheeler is a very pleasant 53-year-old patient from 88581 Augusta, who is being referred to Macdonald Care Center to obtain opinion regarding the future management of his disease.
On October 8, 2009, he underwent a screening colonoscopy during which a cecal mass was found.  Biopsy confirmed the presence of a grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Pathology was reviewed here at Macdonald Care Center.  It is of note that a KRAS status was obtained, and the tumor was classified as KRAS mutated.
On the same-day, a CT-scan without contrast due to prior contrast allergy was performed which revealed two intrahepatic lesions.  Subsequent PET CT-scan on October 13, 2009, revealed about three areas of tracer uptake in the liver.
Subsequently the patient started systemic chemotherapy with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab.  He received six cycles from October to December 31, 2009.  Intent of this chemotherapy was neoadjuvant mainly with the eventual goal to resect primary tumor and metastasis.  It is of note that the tumor marker CEA decreased from 78 to 8 on therapy.  The patient tolerated the treatment very well except for cold sensitivities and fatigue.
A PET scan on January 4, 2010, showed complete resolution of the intrahepatic lesions.  It did not show any tracer uptake anymore.  His surgeon, Dr. Munson, then contacted Dr. Rutland at Macdonald Care Center to see if the situation of disappearing liver metastasis surgical quote was still warranted.  Eventually the patient was referred to Macdonald Care Center for further discussions about the best therapeutic course here.
Upon presentation here, Mr. Wheeler says that he did not have any tumor or treatment-related symptoms anymore.  His sensory neuropathy has completely resolved.  He feels energetic, has no pain, no fever, and no chills.
