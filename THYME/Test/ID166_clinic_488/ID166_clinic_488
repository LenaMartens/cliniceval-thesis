Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Jackson Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Lindsey Armstrong, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Prior to meeting with Mr. Johnson I have reviewed his case in its entirety with Dr. Lindsey Armstrong who again reiterates the recommendations that were outlined in his and Dr. Timmer note dated May 25, 2010.  Understandably Mr. Johnson had a complicated radiation chemotherapy course and needs to take that into consideration when making further recommendations.  Generally would recommend four additional months of systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX-6), however, given the fact that Mr. Johnson has had such complications regarding the past therapy it certainly is viable to consider observation only.  I informed Mr. Johnson that this is a discussion he should have with his local oncologist who will be treating him.  This person has better knowledge of his tolerance of therapies.  I did state that one consideration could be to start the chemotherapy with a significant dose modification of the infusional 5-FU and see how things are tolerated.  Obviously the infusional 5-FU is administered over a shorter period of time and often times is better tolerated.  Also confounding his past symptoms is the fact that he was also receiving radiation therapy concurrently.  Again, this is a discussion he should have with his primary oncologist.  He understands that if he chooses observation only and if the cancer were to reoccur that then he could be treated with chemotherapy.  He had several questions that I answered to his satisfaction.  He denies any further questions or concerns.  He has our telephone number to contact us should he have any further questions or concerns.

Mr. Johnson is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman from Minnesota.  I am seeing him today at the request of Dr. Williams's Service to discuss further treatment recommendations following resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma.
His history is as follows:
1)  Seventeen to eighteen years ago was diagnosed with colon polyps.  At that time he had a right hemicolectomy performed due to these polyps which was not cancerous.
2)  2007 a colonoscopy noting a 5-mm polyp in the transverse colon which was benign.
3)  March 2010 developed constipation with a change in his stool caliber and a sensation of incomplete evacuation.  He was also experiencing perirectal pain.  At this time the patient noted a prominent mass that would extrude from the anus.  When finished defecating, he would push this area back in.
4)  April 5, 2010, colonoscopy noted an ulcerated posterior anal mass that measures approximately 2-cm.  This was biopsy positive for moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma in the background of villous adenoma.  Also noted several 7 to 8-mm sessile transverse colon polyps.  A CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noting soft-tissue fullness at the anal verge.  An indeterminate 4-mm nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung.  Pulmonary emphysema as well as two areas of bronchial thickening.
5)  May 20, 2010,presented to PVCC for further workup. Sigmoidoscopy with EUS noting that the tumor was in the posterior anal canal and extends through the anal sphincter to the adjacent soft-tissue.
Also was noted to have enlarged internal hemorrhoids.  A biopsy of this tissue was positive for superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  Two hyperplastic polyps were removed, one from the sigmoid and one from the rectum.
6)  May 21, 2010, CT chest noting emphysema fibrosis, grand glass opacity, and a stable, 4-mm subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung.
7)  May 24, 2010, Dr. Williams performed a repeat colonoscopy with a biopsy of the anal lesion which was positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma undermining benign anal squamous mucosa and invading into the skeletal muscle.  Recommended chemo-radiation therapy before surgical resection.
8)  May 2010 through July 19, 2010, underwent chemo-radiation therapy.  This was a difficult course for him.  He developed severe diarrhea, malnutrition, and dehydration requiring hospitalization.
9)  On September 20, 2010,  CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noting a stable lung nodule.  New wall thickening of the loop of the pelvic ilium which was possibly radiation enteritis.
10)  September 21, 2010, colonoscopy continued to show an ulcerated lesion at the anal canal.  Biopsy was positive for tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
11)  September 22, 2010, Dr. Williams performed an APR.  Pathology is positive for residual and invasive moderately to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin that is located in multiple localized microscopic foci within the subepithelium, stromas/submucosa at the dentate line.  The adenocarcinoma focally undermines the underlining squamous mucosa and comes to within 1.1-cm of the distal margin.  Remaining margins are negative.  Four lymph nodes removed, all negative for malignancy (pT1, N0).
Today, Mr. Johnson is three days postoperative.  He is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  His wife is present during this consultation.
