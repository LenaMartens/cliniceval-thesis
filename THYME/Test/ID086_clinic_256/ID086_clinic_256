#1 Metastatic rectal cancer with a history of resected liver metastasis
Prior to meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Padro, I have had the opportunity to review his past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  I have also had the opportunity to review this case in its entirety with my collaborating provider, Dr. Hernandez, who is in agreement with this plan.  At this time, it is recommended that he proceed with radiation therapy.  In fact, he is scheduled for simulation tomorrow and then to initiate radiation on March 8, 2010.  At this time, recommending that he be treated with oral Xeloda therapy.  I am checking into the coverage from his insurance regarding this treatment modality.  If this is not covered well, would then proceed with infusional 5-FU.  In regard to follow-up, I have informed Mr. Padro he would then have a month off following radiation therapy and then return approximately at that time to discuss any further therapy.  At this time, Dr. Hernandez is recommending observation only.  Dr. Hernandez has also recommended that I counsel some of the other GI oncologists as to their recommendations.  We will be contacting patient with the information.
#2 Follow-up
Plan to see Mr. Padro back approximately two-weeks into the start of his radiation therapy or approximately the week of March 22, 2010.  He denies any further questions or concerns.  He has our telephone number to contact us should he have any further questions or concerns.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Collaborating physician and primary oncologist is Dr. Deskins

Mr. Padro is a pleasant 52-year-old gentleman from East Hardwick, Vermont.  I am seeing him for a history of a re-resected colorectal cancer.  For comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated July 31, 2008.
Briefly, his history is as follows:
1. August 2003 endoscopic resection of T1, grade 3, lower rectum adenocarcinoma.
2. July 2008 rectal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis for which he received FOLFOX plus Avastin for two-months followed by FOLFOX alone for one-month, achieving a minor response.
3.  December 9, 2008, resection of liver metastasis, resection of the rectum with coloanal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy, left common iliac nodal dissection for rectal cancer with liver and lymph node metastasis, rendered  NED.  Resection of liver metastasis as well as reexcision of rectal adenocarcinoma with a left common iliac nodal dissection.  Patient rendered NED.  All tissue removed was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
4.  April 14, 2009, completed adjuvant FOLFOX plus Avastin therapy.
5.  December 15, 2009, CT abdomen and pelvis notes development of a 2-cm indeterminate presacral soft-tissue mass worrisome for recurrent disease.  In retrospect, it was present on previous scans but much smaller.
6.  December 16, 2009, PET/CT performed noting uptake in the 2-cm presacral mass.  Most consistent with a recurrent metastases.  Also PET positive is a-1-cm common iliac lymph node.  There is also a new hypermetabolism in the posterior right lobe of the liver resection region.
7.  December 17, 2009, biopsy of the presacral mass positive for malignancy, recurrent adenocarcinoma.
8.  January 19, 2010, Dr. Puckett performed an abdominal perineal resection with a resection of a presacral tumor en bloc with the rectum.  Resection of the tip of the coccyx as well as periaortic and common iliac nodes.  Abdominal exploration and then intraoperative radiation performed by Dr. Irvin.  Dr. Smith performed a local excision of a previous excision of metastatic tumor site.  Pathology from the left pericommon ileac lymph node and left common ileac lymph node-positive for metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Pathology of the sigmoid rectum is positive for metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma near the anastomosis site.  Three additional nodules in the perirectal soft-tissue also are involved by carcinoma.  Ten regional lymph nodes removed all are negative for metastatic disease.  Pathology of the coccyx region bone negative for tumor.  Abdominal wound nodules fat necrosis and then liver wedge resection of the right lode notes multinodular foreign body granulomatosis reaction.
Today Mr. Padro is being seen for consideration of chemoradiation therapy following his most recent procedure.  He reports that he is feeling very well except for the fact that he continues to experience some pain in the tailbone area.  He states that his skin has totally healed and that the pain he feels is deep internal.  He reports that it is difficulty for him to sit.  He was treating himself with Tylenol for this discomfort with moderate relief.  States that oxycodone did not offer any better relief and, in fact, caused more side-effects for him in unsteadiness.  States that he has no difficulties with his ostomy site.  He is no longer needing to in-and-out catheterize himself, and his bladder is working quite well.
