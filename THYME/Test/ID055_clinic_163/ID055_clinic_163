#1 Stage II colon cancer
Mr. Brown is a 76-year-old gentleman who was recently found to have a colon mass after he presented with fatigue and anemia.  He underwent surgery, and pathology revealed stage II colon cancer.  We discussed with Mr. Brown and his wife that there is very high likelihood that he is cured with surgery.  We discussed that treatment with chemotherapy is controversial with his stage of disease.  We did discuss that the fact that he does not have microsatellite instability puts him at indeterminate risk.  If he decides to pursue chemotherapy, then the standard chemotherapy option would be FOLFOX regimen.  The patient is interested in pursuing oral capecitabine.  We did discuss that this medication might not be approved for stage II treatment.  We discussed possibility of enrolling in a clinical trial that is actually open in his hometown.  That is the E5202 trial performing 18q genetic analysis and then randomizing patients to either no treatment if they are deemed low-risk or to treatment with FOLFOX plus or minus Avastin.  We discussed that this might be a good option for the patient as it may mean that he really does not need any further chemotherapy.  Mr. Brown would like to think about this.  He wants to think whether he would like to pursue treatment closer to home or at SMCCHC.  He is also strongly considering starting oral capecitabine.  He will contact his insurance and find out whether this medication would be covered for him.  All questions were answered.  I also filled return-to-work form for the patient and provided him with a return-to-work letter. He works as a valet part-time at a local hospital.
#2 Nausea
The patient describes persistent nausea and diarrhea since his contrast study. Somewhat unusual to have delayed symptoms at this point from allergic reaction. One could consider viral gastroenteritis. I provided the patient with prescription for compazine to use as-needed for nausea.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at SMCCHC.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mr. Brown is a pleasant 76-year-old gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Mr. Brown's history is as follows:
1)  In 2005 he had a colonoscopy performed with removal of several small polyps.  Recommended repeat scope in two-to-three years.
2)  July 23, 2010, presented to his provider with fatigue and was found to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 6.6.  He underwent blood transfusions as well as iron administration.
3)  July 27, 2010, presented to SMCCHC for further workup.  A colonoscopy performed to the cecum noting a 3-mm polyp in the ascending colon that was removed.  Also in the ascending colon near the hepatic flexure was a cauliflower like polypoid mass that was 3 to 4-cm, friable, and encased one-third of the circumference.  Also noted was an intact 3 to 4-mm polyp in the transverse colon.  Pathology of the polyp was a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  A biopsy of the ascending mass positive for invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
4)  July 30, 2010, CT abdomen and pelvis noting a barely identifiable thickening of the ascending colon.  Tiny low-density focus in the right lobe of the liver times two which is too small to characterize, probable cyst.  Stable subpleural nodules in the right lower lung.  An aortic abdominal aneurysm graft repair with an endo leak that is stable.
5)  August 16, 2010, Dr. Bradley performed a right hemicolectomy.  Pathology is positive for moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon.  Surgical resected margins are negative.  All of 21 regional lymph nodes negative for metastatic disease (T3, N0).  Results of microsatellite instability did not demonstrate the presence of defective DNA mismatch repair function within the tumor (MSS/MSI-L).
Mr. Brown is here today with his wife to talk about results of the testing and any additional treatment options for his stage II colorectal carcinoma.  He reports recovering quite well from the surgery, and he was really feeling great until yesterday when he had developed nausea after drinking oral contrast dye in Radiology.  Since then, he has had persistent diarrhea and nausea.  He denies ever having any reaction to contrast agent before.
He denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, vision problems, or headache.  He does not have any persistent bony aches or pains.  He was not losing weight prior to the diagnosis or currently.

His past history has included the following diagnoses:
1) Status-post endovascular repair, asymptomatic abdominal aneurysm, complicated with a small type II endo vascular leak.
2) Microscopic hematuria (evaluation negative except for a small intrarenal calculus).
3) Negative exercise stress sestamibi for coronary ischemia (2004).
4) Multiple bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules on CT scanning (no change after one-year).
5) Hypertriglyceridemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia consistent with metabolic syndrome.
6) Hypertension.
7) Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis and normal LV size and systolic and diastolic function on echocardiography 2003.
8) Diabetes mellitus, Type II.
9) Negative exercise sestamibi for ischemia, double product 22,352 on Bruce protocol 7 minutes, no angina.
10) Colonoscopy 2005 done at-home.
11) Asymptomatic hyperuricemia.
12) Elevated liver transaminase, most likely secondary to fatty infiltration of the liver (NASH syndrome) with previously negative hepatitis profile and iron studies.
13) Overweight.
14) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation currently well-controlled on Rythmol.
15) Probable mild obstructive sleep apnea with previously mildly abnormal overnight.
16) Mild hypercalcemia with low-normal PTH levels, currently on low-dose hydrochlorothiazide.
