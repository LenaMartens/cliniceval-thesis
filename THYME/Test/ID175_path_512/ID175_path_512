Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, segment 3, biopsy:  Cavernous hemangioma (1.0 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm).

B.  Left colon, resection:  Grade (2 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 7.0 x 6.0 cm annular mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (1 of 27) regional lymph nodes is positive for tumor (size of metastasis less than 0.1 cm).  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2009).

C.  Soft tissue, right chest wall nodule, biopsy:  Fibroepithelial polyp.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
