#1 Resected metastatic colon cancer to the liver (T3, N2 (17 of 40) M1 liver)
Mr. Hager is a pleasant 67-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer who underwent partial resection of his metastatic disease in his liver.  He also underwent portal vein embolization with an ultimate plan to return for further evaluation and surgical resection of the right lobe of the liver.
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Freeman's and Dr. Hernandez's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Fowler, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have explained in-depth with Mr. Hager, his wife, and his daughter the overall tentative plan to have him return in four weeks for evaluation and plan of care making.  He will undergo a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis and chest, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, postoperative evaluation with Dr. Freeman as well as a formal consultation with us in Medical Oncology.  He understands this and will plan on getting his chemotherapy closer to home either in West Harwich or at SMC in 27516 where he has an additional home.  I have given him my card, he knows to call if there are problems or concerns regarding his potential overall plan but also understands that the ultimate plan has not been yet finalized pending his appointment in four weeks.  He does plan on making contact with his local medical oncologist prior to his arrival at East Texas Memorial Hospital in a month to help ensure continuity of care.

I have been asked by Dr. Freeman and Dr. Hernandez to visit with Mr. Hager for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Hager is a very pleasant 67-year-old male from Salem, Indiana.  He has been seen here in the past by Dr. Milligan of Cardiology for a history of aortic insufficiency, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
1.  September 2010.  Presented with a six-week history of progressive abdominal bloating and cramping.  CT imaging done locally showed a large colon mass and multiple bilobular liver lesions.  Colonoscopy performed showing a partially obstructing mass at the ileocolonic junction.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  Patient also complained of progressive anorexia and weight-loss.
2.  October 11, 2010.  Taken by Dr. Hernandez and Dr. Freeman for a joint resection.  Operative report not available at time of dictation but did speak with Dr. Hernandez's Service.  Surgical pathology from the liver portions segments III & IV wedge resections note metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a colon primary forming a 3.8- x 3.6- x 3.3-cm mass.  The surgical resection margins is negative for tumor (minimum tumor-free margins 0.1 cm).  One of two pericholedochal lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a colon primary with a size of 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2-cm.  Right hemicolectomy also showing invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma forming a 6.7- x 2.8- x 2.0-cm mass circumferential in the ileal cecal valve region.  Invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat involving 17 of 40 regional lymph nodes with negative surgical margins.  No other disease noted but the right-side of the liver metastatic deposits left in place and patient underwent a portal vein embolization with intent to return after hypertrophy of the right lobe of the liver for further surgical resection of metastatic disease.
Mr. Hager is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
