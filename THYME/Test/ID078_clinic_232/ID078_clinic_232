#1 Metastatic KRAS-mutant colon cancer
#2 Pulmonary nodules
Mrs. Clark is recovering well from her surgical metastasectomies.  She has no new symptoms or exam findings worrisome for cancer recurrence.  However, I reviewed with her, her CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and this shows three enlarging pulmonary nodules.  I explained to her that these are worrisome for metastases, although I am not absolutely certain that they are metastases.  I recommended that given their tiny size and asymptomatic nature we can observe these for now.  I also discussed with her that if these lesions grow, she has already received and had progressive disease on all agents known to be active in colon cancer (5-FU, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, cetuximab, bevacizumab.  I, therefore, recommended that if she develops clear evidence of disease progression we could consider a clinical trial.  She understands and agrees with the plan.  I will see her back in two-months.

1.  October 2005 - developed right lower quadrant pain.  This was evaluated by colonoscopy.  Cecal biopsy October 31, 2005, showed tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
2.  November 2, 2005 - underwent right hemicolectomy.  Pathology showed grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.0- x 5.0- x 2.5-cm mass.  Two (of 21) regional lymph nodes were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
3.  January 6, 2006 - suspicious masses concerning for metastasis were found on the right ovary.  Underwent hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.  Pathology showed grade 2 (of 4), mucinous adenocarcinoma forming nodules of 3.9 and 2.9 cm involving the right ovary.  Per the patient's report, she received intraperitoneal mitomycin-C after surgery for one treatment.  This was followed by six-months of treatment with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.
4.  December 2006 - surveillance PET/CT showed an FDG-avid mass near the rectum.
5.  January 16, 2007 - evaluated at H by Dr. Graham and Dr. Ostrowski.  Dr. Ostrowski recommended resection of the rectal mass.  She underwent resection on January 16.  Pathology showed metastatic, grade 3 (of 4), mucinous adenocarcinoma forming a 2.6- x 2.4- x 1.9-cm mass in the pelvis and a portion of the vaginal wall along with metastatic, grade 3 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma forming a 0.9- x 0.8-  0.3-cm mass in the liver.  A focus of adenocarcinoma in the right peritoneum was also resected.  KRAS mutation analysis showed this to be a KRAS-mutant tumor.  However, the KRAS testing was not initially available.
6.  2007 - initiated 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and cetuximab.  During chemotherapy, she developed a small-bowel obstruction requiring repeat resection on June 26, 2007.  No evidence of disease was found at the time of repeat surgery.
7.  January 2008 - chemotherapy was switched to 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab.
8.  April 2009 - chemotherapy switched to 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab.
9.  September 2009 - chemotherapy switched to capecitabine and bevacizumab.
10.  May 2010 - developed rising CEA and a mass in the mesentery.  Chemotherapy was switched to 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab.
11.  September 10, 2010 -- underwent abdominal exploration and resection of multiple metastases.  Pathology showed adenocarcinoma grade 2 (of 4) found in the peritoneum, small-bowel, the ileocolonic anastomosis, the sigmoid colon, some pelvic soft-tissue nodules, and the right lateral abdominal wall.  Surgical recovery was unremarkable.
Mrs. Clark returns for reevaluation of metastatic colon cancer.  She states that her surgical recovery has been uncomplicated.  She does note some pain in the right lower quadrant that occasionally radiates down her leg.  This is 3 to 4/10 in maximal intensity and is relieved by acetaminophen.  She has not sought medical attention due to her pain, and it has not significantly interfered with her quality of life.  In addition to this, she notes some bladder issues including urinary urgency and incontinence at times in the morning and slight increase in frequency of urine and stool.  She has no urinary urgency during the day and no dysuria.  Her symptoms are distinctly dissimilar to a prior UTI about a month ago.  Other than this, she has no new complaints.  Performance status is 0.
