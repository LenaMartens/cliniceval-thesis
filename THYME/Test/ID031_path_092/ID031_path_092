Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  An ulcer (0.8 x 0.3 cm) with biopsy site changes is noted within the ascending colon. No residual tumor.  A tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia (0.8 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm) is also noted within the cecum.  Surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia.  Appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  A single (of 29) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma; the size of the metastasis is 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.  Extranodal extension is present. 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
