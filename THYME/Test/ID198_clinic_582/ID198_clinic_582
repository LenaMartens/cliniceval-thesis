#1 Rectal cancer
I agree with Sheila Peterson's well-outlined recommendation, assessment, and treatment plan.  Mr. Mclaurin, his wife, and I discussed that he has rectal cancer and that we would need to obtain further staging information.  He will have an endorectal ultrasound and a colonoscopy with tattoo of the area in the event that he does need radiation or chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.  He will have a CT-scan of the chest.  We will have the outside CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis reviewed here.  We also discussed with him the importance of considering Lynch syndrome.  I gave him literature on this as well as the price codes for the insurance immunohistochemistry and MSI testing, and he would like to proceed with that.  We also will try to preschedule Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology appointments, although he would like to pursue this near his home.

Mr. Mclaurin is a 48-year-old gentleman who has a recent diagnosis of rectal cancer.  He had developed right upper quadrant pain, and actually had had that for years but then noticed he had some hematochezia.  Apparently his pain was significant enough to prompt him to go to the emergency room, and in the emergency room he was found to have a normal abdominal ultrasound and biliary scan.  His CT-scan was negative, but then for follow-up on July 22, 2010 he had a colonoscopy, and at that point, he was found to have a 3-cm rectal mass biopsy-proven to be rectal adenocarcinoma.  It was approximately 8-cm above the anal verge, by the colonoscopy report, and there was an ascending tubular adenoma and a descending tubular adenoma.  His hemoglobin was 13.4.  He has a family history of a grandfather having colorectal cancer in his 90s.  He has a concurrent medical history of obesity and diabetes mellitus times 14 years which has been poorly-controlled.  He also has some sleeping disturbance but not frank sleep apnea.  He has asthma and hypercholesterolemia.
The PFH and CVI is outlined by Jamie Peterson in her note today.  Physical exam per Jamie Peterson.
