A.	Portion of sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, forming a 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm ulcerative mass in the rectum, 1.1 cm from the dentate line.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4 of 27) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Multiple (4) tumor deposits are identified in the perirectal adipose tissue.
