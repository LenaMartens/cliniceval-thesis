Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, left, colectomy:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated forming a 7.2 x 6.7 x 4.4 cm ulcerative annular mass in the left colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The serosa is uninvolved.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (20) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material, [AJCCpT3N0MX] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
