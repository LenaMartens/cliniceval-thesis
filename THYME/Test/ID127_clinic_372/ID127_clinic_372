#1 Treatment recommendations for resected sigmoid colon cancer, now with local recurrence
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Coe through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mrs. Walton is a pleasant 72-year-old woman from Tempe.  We are seeing her today to discuss treatment for an individual who has had a resected stage II sigmoid colon cancer, now with local recurrence.  Her history is as follows:
1.  January 16, 2008, CT-scan performed at that time due to intermittent abdominal pain and a 20-pound weight-loss.  At that time was felt to have cholelithiasis as well as diverticulitis in the sigmoid colon.
2.  September 11, 2008, due to the fact patient became anemic (6.8), underwent a colonoscopy which noted a constricting distal sigmoid cancer 20 to 22 cm from the anal verge.  Biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.  Not able to bypass this mass.  EGD performed on this date negative.
3.  September 29, 2008, underwent a low-anterior resection.  Per the operative report, the tumor acted like diverticulitis and was twisted and stuck down in the pelvis.  The appendix was stuck down in the pelvis near the tumor.  Appendix was removed and found to be negative for malignancy.  Pathology of the sigmoid was moderate to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon.  Nine lymph nodes removed all negative.  There was a question of angiolymphatic invasion.  All surgical resected margins were negative (T3, N0, M0).
4.  October 24, 2008, patient was seen by her local oncologist and offered chemotherapy due to the fact that she was considered high-risk.  After much debate, patient decided to continue with observation only.
5.  December 1, 2008, PET/CT-scan performed noting a small solitary focus of increased radiotracer activity in the posterior aspect of the pelvis to the left of midline which was nonspecific.
6.  March 9, 2009, CT-scan and PET scan both negative.
7.  September 9, 2009, CT abdomen and pelvis noting mid to lower pelvic cystic area in the same area of the previously resected pelvic mass (this is per physician's note--do not have a written report of this CT-scan).
8.  November 11, 2009, underwent a colonoscopy which noted that there were three sutures at the anastomotic site.  Over one of the sutures, there was overgrowth of tissue that was biopsied and found to be fragments of tubular adenoma and adjacent polypoid granulation tissue.  Negative for high-grade malignancy.  Also removed from the ascending colon was a sessile, serrated adenoma.
9.  November 17, 2009, presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain.  A CT-scan at that time noting a new lesion in the pelvis measuring 3.4 cm abutting and intermittently associated with vaginal cuff and serosal surface of small-bowel loops contained within the pelvis.  Also was new pericolic gutter fluid and pelvic ascites.
10. December 3, 2009, underwent biopsy of this pelvic mass which was positive for moderate to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with colorectal primary.  K-ras testing performed noting a mutation.
11. December 30, 2009, through February 24, 2010, treated with five treatments of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  After her first dose had medication modified due to fatigue.  Second treatment did have decreased blood counts and started on Neulasta supplementation after that therapy.  She has had two CT scans since that time on January 14, 2010, where the CT-scan was similar to the November 17 scan and February 10 scan questioning a possibility of a decrease in the size of the lesions.
Mrs. Walton states that her appetite has been fair.  She does have some nausea associated with her chemotherapy administration, and she does require some antiemetic therapy.  She takes approximately two-to-three tablets after her therapy.  Cold sensitivity lasts until approximately three or four days before her next treatment cycle.  Does experience constipation associated with this treatment and at this time is using prune juice that has been effective in maintaining a daily bowel movement that is absent of blood or mucus.  Denies any changes to the skin in her mouth, hands, or feet.  Energy level is low for the first three days following discontinuation of the pump.  She denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.  Cold sensitivity does have associated neuropathy.  Does not have neuropathy other than times when she is cold.  This goes away for about three or four days before her next treatment, as previously stated.
