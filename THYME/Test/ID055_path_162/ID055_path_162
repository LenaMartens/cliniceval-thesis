Final Diagnosis
A.  Right hemicolectomy;  terminal ileum, cecum, ascending & transverse bowel:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.6 x 2.9 x 1.1 cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphovascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (21) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).  Unremarkable appendix.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right hemicolectomy, terminal ilium, cecum; ascending & transverse bowel"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 5.2 cm of terminal ileum, 17.0 cm of colon, and a 6.5 x 0.4 cm appendix.  A 3.6 x 2.9 x 1.9 cm polypoid mass is present within the ascending colon, 6.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 10.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HODGE.


Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Jesse Barner, CNP, PCR-based testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) will be performed on ascending colon cancer tissue sections (block A2); when completed, results will be available in SUOJ IlfbCygg.
