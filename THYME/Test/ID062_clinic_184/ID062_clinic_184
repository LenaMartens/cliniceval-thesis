IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, stage IV (T4, N2, M1), grade 3, May 11, 2010
#2 Status-post palliative right hemicolectomy, May 11, 2010
#3 History of gout
#4 History of renal insufficiency
#5 Morbid obesity
I reviewed the results of the pathology with the patient and his wife today.  I did inform him that he has metastatic disease at this time with the presence of the omental and peritoneal METS.  His staging has not been completed in view that we do not have a chest CT.  It appears from the exploratory laparotomy he did not have intrahepatic lesions; although, there were lesions superficially over his liver.  I think a CT with IV contrast of the abdomen would be reasonable upon his return visit in the outpatient setting.  We talked about the use of palliative chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic colon cancer.  The patient does not have a history of venous thromboembolism or bleeding.  Therefore, as first-line therapy I would use FOLFOX with bevacizumab.  He was concerned with regard to the financial aspect of his treatment in view that he would not be able to work during chemotherapy.  This is because of the nature of his work whereby he would lift machinery up to 100 pounds on a daily basis; and with the presence of a port and also going through cycles of fatigue while going through chemotherapy, continuing with his full-time job may not be feasible; and therefore, his insurance might run out.  I have asked him to talk with the hospital social worker to find out if he can start identifying resources for financial assistance.  The patient is interested in following-up here at KCH and also to have his chemotherapy done here at KCH as well.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.  Return visit to Medical Oncology in approximately four weeks with updated imaging studies and labs.  The updated imaging studies would include CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
2.  I will add a CEA unto his stored serum prior to surgery.
3.  I would also add iron studies on his current labs in view that he has evidence of microcytic anemia.  He may need iron-replacement therapy postoperatively.
4.  The patient will need a port to start his chemotherapy, and this can be done as an outpatient with Vascular Interventional Radiology when he returns in four weeks.
5.  We will also consider a brain MRI when he returns for his followup appointments in view of his headaches which have become more severe recently.
6.  We will mail his appointments to his home.
Thank-you for the consult.  Please call 623-411-01350 with questions.
This consult will be staffed by Dr. High tomorrow.

Mr. Dunn is a 56-year-old gentleman from 24002 44026, with a past medical history significant for gout, morbid obesity, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  April 2010 -- the patient developed a severe right-sided abdominal pain after shoveling.  This was evaluated by his local emergency room, and he was found to have a hemoglobin of 9.9.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis on April 24, 2010, showed mild pericolonic stranding involving the cecum and ascending colon.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for presumed colitis.  He then underwent a colonoscopy locally on April 27, 2010, and endoscopic biopsies reviewed here showed colonic mucosa with high-grade dysplasia.
2.  May 6, 2010 -- the patient comes to Ivanhoe General Hospital for further evaluation.  He undergoes a colonoscopy on May 7, 2010, and a malignant-appearing tumor is noted at the hepatic flexure.  Biopsy of this mass confirms invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.
3.  May 11, 2010 -- the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy for the tumor mass; however, upon exploratory laparotomy carcinomatosis with a large omental implant as well as mesenteric and parietal peritoneal implants throughout the abdomen, particularly above the liver and in the pelvis, were found.  The liver appeared remarkably free of tumor except for maybe one or two superficial and very small nodules.  Therefore, a palliative right hemicolectomy was performed.  Final pathology of the right colonic mass confirms moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 4- x 2.5- x 2-cm mass in the ascending colon, 6.5 cm from the distal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat and involves the serosal surface.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  Multiple (6 of 21) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Biopsies of the omental and peritoneal lesions were consistent with metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin.
Prior to surgery, aside from the abdominal pain the patient did have loose stools which is normal for him for the past several years.  He would go to the bathroom three-to-four times a day with stools of soft/watery consistency.  Caffeine made his loose stools worse.  No nausea/vomiting.  No back pain, chest pain, fevers, night sweats, hematochezia, or hematuria.  He did have chills for the past two-weeks.  He does have headaches which he feels may be associated with tapering of his prednisone.  He does have numbness in his left toes and ball of his left foot.  Occasionally, he has numbness in both hands as well. ECOG performance status was zero prior to surgery.
