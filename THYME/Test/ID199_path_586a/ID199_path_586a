Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, resection:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm ulcerated mass.  Tumor invades the submucosa.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4) hyperplastic polyps.  Multiple (19) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa identified.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT1 N0] (7th edition, 2010).

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in DCME EhsjKitp.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of sigmoid, rectum (WHITE stitch marks distal margin)"" is a 4.0 cm in length portion of oriented rectum.  There is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass with heaped up edges, 2.7 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the mucosa.  Additionally received is a 22.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid.  Four rectal polyps ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm are identified.  No additional masses are identified.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by AGEE.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""distal anastomotic ring-rectum"" is a 2.8 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm portion of grossly unremarkable mucosal anastomotic ring with staples.  Gross only.  Grossed by FELLOWS
