Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph node, right pericolic, biopsy:  A single right pericolic lymph node is negative for tumor.

B.  Colon, extended right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, most consistent with colonic origin, is identified forming a fungating, ulcerated mass (9.4 x 6.0 x 1.4 cm) in the cecum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic soft tissue and extends to involve the muscularis of an adjacent loop of terminal ileum as well as the perivesical soft tissue of an attached portion of bladder wall.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (3 of 55) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N1b].

Photograph taken.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right pericolic lymph node"" is a single 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm lymph node.  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by SUMLER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, portion of transverse colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 80.5 cm of terminal ileum and 35.5 cm of cecum, ascending, and portion of transverse colon.  The appendix is not present.  There is also a 4.4 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm portion of bladder wall and sidewall attached to the cecum.  A 9.4 x 6.0 x 1.4 cm ulcerative and polypoid mass is present within the cecum involving the ileocecal valve and extending into the terminal ileum. Tumor perforation is absent.  The mass is 33.0 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  A loop of the terminal ileum is adherent to the cecum at the site of the tumor.  Adhesions are present causing loops of the terminal ileum to be adherent.  Multiple (56) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  The two largest grossly positive lymph nodes measure 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm and 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm.  Representative sections are submitted.  Photograph taken.  Grossed by SUMLER.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jesse Andrews, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded cecal adenocarcinoma tissue (block B1).  Upon completion, results will be available in TJMB CvqmMwvr.


Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jesse Andrews, BRAF mutation analysis and PCR analysis for microsatellite instability will be performed on paraffin-embedded cecal adenocarcinoma (block B3); when completed, results will be available in TJMB CvqmMwvr.



Internal Comments
5/27/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for k-ras mutation analysis at request of Dr. A. Andrews/rjc
