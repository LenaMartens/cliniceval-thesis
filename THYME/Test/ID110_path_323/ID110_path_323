Final Diagnosis
Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.4 x 3.6 x 1.2 cm ulcerative, nearly-annular mass, situated 4.8 cm from the distal resection margin.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve pericolonic adipose tissue and the free serosal surface (visceral peritoneum).  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Diverticulosis (28 diverticula) is also present .  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (closest tumor-free margin, 0.7 cm, radial fat margin.  Multiple (6 of 23) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with extranodal extension identified.  [AJCCpT4aN2MX]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description

Received fresh labeled sigmoid colon is a left hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 21.8cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with a 5.4 x 3.6 x 1.2 cm ulcerative, nearly-annular mass within the sigmoid colon, located 4.8 cm from the closest (distal) mucosal resection margin, and 0.7 cm from the radial margin.  The tumor puckers the free serosal surface.  The deepest extent of the tumor is 1.2 cm and tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (26) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Multiple (28) diverticula are identified.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by CURTIS.
