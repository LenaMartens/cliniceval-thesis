Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 5.1 x 3.4 x 1.3 cm ulcerated mass, located 9.2 cm from the closest mucosal resection margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  The radial mesenteric margin is free by 2.5 cm.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (12) diverticula are also identified.  Multiple (16) regional lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).
