Final Diagnosis
A.  Small bowel, biopsy:  Mild fibrosis, negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Manuel M. Moreira, M.D.

B.  Small bowel, terminal ileum, resection:  The intestinal serosa and muscularis propria are involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Manuel M. Moreira, M.D.

C.  Vagina, margin #1, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Vagina, margin #2, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

E.  Rectosigmoid anastomosis, portion of ileum, posterior vaginal wall; resection:  Involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary forming a mass (2.9 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm) within the soft tissue between colon and vaginal wall. The colonic mucosa shows ulceration with associated granulation tissue.  Multiple (12) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel"" is a 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm red-tan tissue fragment.  All submitted.  Grossed by DUARTE.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum"" is a 12.7 cm segment of small bowel with a transmural defect and surrounding erythema and fibrosis.  The mucosa is erythematous and ulcerated over a 7.8 cm area.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DUARTE.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""vaginal margin #1"" is a 2.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm portion of soft tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by ROBINSON.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""vaginal margin #2"" is a 1.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm portion of soft tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by ROBINSON.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""rectosigmoid anastomosis, portion of ileum, posterior vaginal wall"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 13.5 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 17.5 cm portion of small bowel.  A 2.9 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm white firm mass is present within the sigmoid serosa, 1.1 cm below the colonic mucosa, 2.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin, and 0.3 cm from the vaginal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SALGADO.
