#1 Stage III colon cancer
Mrs. Moya has had resection of her T3, N1 malignancy.  She has a significant risk of recurrence without further therapy in the realm of 60% over the next five years.  We have recommended adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX-based regimen for approximately 12 cycles or six-months.  We discussed the risk and benefits of oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and leucovorin to include neuropathy, cold sensitivity, cytopenias, nausea, and fatigue.  Patient consents to therapy.  We will place a port tomorrow if possible and then start chemotherapy the day after.
#2 Pulmonary infiltrates
The patient is recovering from an upper respiratory illness, is essentially fully recovered from this.  I think it is safe to proceed with chemotherapy.  This may also explain her small pulmonary infiltrates.  We will keep an eye on this.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
