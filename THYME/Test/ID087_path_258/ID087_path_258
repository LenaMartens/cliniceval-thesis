Final Diagnosis
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis.  A single negative cystic duct lymph node is also identified.

B.  Liver, portions of segments III and IV, wedge resection:  Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary forming a 3.8 x 3.6 x 3.3 cm mass.  The surgical resection margin is negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.1 cm).  The non-neoplastic liver parenchyma shows mild macrovesicular steatosis, mild portal chronic inflammation and portal fibrosis.  Seen in consultation with Dr. Dale J. Fitzgerald.

C.  Lymph nodes, pericholedochal, biopsy:  A single (1 of 2) pericholedochal lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary.  The size of the metastasis measures 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm.

D.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 6.7 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm exophytic and circumferential mass in the ileocecal valve region, located 7.5 cm from the proximal terminal ileal resection margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The proximal and distal surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (17 of 40) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled gallbladder is a 9.8 x 5.7 x 1.8 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is identified.  No stones are present within the lumen.  No masses are identified.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by FISHER.

B.  Received fresh labeled liver, portions of segments III and IV is a 55.0 gram, 6.1 x 5.3 x 3.4 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 3.8 x 3.6 x 3.3 cm white lobulated mass is present 0.1 cm from the surgical resection margin.  The margin is submitted perpendicularly.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by FISHER.

C.  Received fresh labeled pericholedochal lymph nodes are multiple (2) lymph nodes (2.5 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm with a 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm metastatic nodule, and 3.7 x 1.9 x 0.8 cm).  The largest lymph node is entirely submitted and a portion of the grossly positive lymph node is submitted.  Grossed by FISHER.

D.  Received fresh labeled right colon is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 7.0 cm of terminal ileum, and a 21.5 cm segment of cecum and ascending colon.  No appendix is grossly identified.  A 6.7 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm annular mass is present within the right colon at the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 7.5 cm from the ileal mucosal resection margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat and are submitted for permanent sections only.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by GRIFFIN.   



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis.  A single negative cystic duct lymph node. HOLD to confirm.

B.  Liver, portions of segments III and IV, wedge resection:  Metastatic carcinoma. Margin negative.  HOLD to assess non-neoplastic liver parenchyma on permanent section.

C.  Lymph nodes, pericholedochal, biopsy:  A single (1 of 2) pericholedochal lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma. HOLD to confirm.

D.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive adenocarcinoma. Margins are negative.  HOLD to assess lymph nodes on permanent sections.

Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Ashley Cooper, CNP, k-ras and BRAF mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded right colon adenocarcinoma tissue (block D1).  Upon completion, results will be available in QBDT DrqmThur.


Internal Comments
10/15/10 - 6 molgen cuts to MG for k-ras & BRAF mutation analysis at request of Ashley Cooper, CNP/rjc
