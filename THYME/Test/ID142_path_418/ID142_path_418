Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, segment 6 mass #1, biopsy: Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary forming a 1.4 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm nodule.  The resection margin is negative for tumor.

B.  Liver, segment 6 mass #2, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary forming a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm nodule, 0.3 cm from the inked margin.

C.  Liver, segment 8 mass, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary forming a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.8 cm nodule, 0.1 cm from the nearest cauterized margin.

D.  Liver, segment 2 mass, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary forming a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm nodule, 0.1 cm from the margin.

E.  Liver, segment 2 new deep margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

F.  Colon, rectosigmoid, proctectomy:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.4 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm ulcerated mass in the proximal rectum, 5.5 cm from the distal resection margin.  Adenocarcinoma invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Focal treatment associated changes are identified.  Lymphovascular space invasion is present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. The radial resection margin is negative for malignancy by 1.0 cm.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in multiple (5 of 24) regional lymph nodes.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""liver-segment 6 mass #1"" is a 38.6 gram, 6.5 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm aggregate of liver tissue.  A single 1.4 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm white mass is present at the surgical margin.   Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HARRISON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""liver-segment 6 mass #2"" is a 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm portion of liver with a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm tan nodule 0.3 cm from the inked margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""liver-segment 8 mass"" is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm fragment of red-brown liver tissue.  A 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm white-yellow mass is present at the liver capsule and 0.1 cm from the nearest margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HARRISON.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""liver-segment 2 mass"" is a 2.0 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm portion of liver with a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan nodule 0.1 cm from the margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""liver-segment 2-new deep margin"" is a 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm fragment of liver without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 25.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon. (The radial margin is inked).  A 3.4 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 5.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 1.0 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HARRISON.
