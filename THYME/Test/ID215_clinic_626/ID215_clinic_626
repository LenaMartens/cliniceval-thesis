#1 Adenocarcinoma of the descending colon
As Ms. Marcantel's right-side of the colon was unable to be visualized due to the near obstructing mass lesion in her left colon, we would recommend a colonoscopy to be attempted in the complex suite in order to rule-out any synchronous lesions.  At the time of colonoscopy, tissue samples will be obtained in order to be read by our pathologists.  We will also make arrangements for the patient to undergo PET scan due to the concerning lesions in the right adrenal gland as well as the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver.  Ms. Marcantel is scheduled to see Dr. Jennings in Colorectal Surgery for further evaluation and recommendations regarding laparoscopic surgery.  If and when Ms. Marcantel is scheduled for surgery, she is OK to proceed with general anesthesia.  We have explained to the patient and her husband that final tumor staging would be done post-operatively.  If indicated, further discussions of chemotherapy would be performed by the medical oncology team at that time.
#2 Barrett's esophagus
Once Ms. Marcantel has recovered from surgery, we would recommend the use of proton-pump inhibitor therapy such as omeprazole 20-mg daily.  She should follow-up with her local physician for serial monitoring with a repeat EGD and biopsies within the next year in order to rule-out dysplastic changes and to determine long-term followup plans for the Barrett's esophagus.
Ms. Marcantel and her husband were in understanding and agreement with this plan.  All questions were answered.
FOLLOW-UP
Ms. Marcantel will follow-up after all tests and consults.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at Zuni Cooperative Hospital.

Ms. Marcantel is a very pleasant 57-year-old female from Enterprise, MS, with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and reactive airways disease who presents to the GI Neoplasia Clinic for further evaluation and recommendations regarding a newly-diagnosed colon cancer.
Ms. Marcantel was in her normal state of health until approximately two-to-three months ago when she started to experience progressively worsening fatigue.  Associated with the fatigue she also noted a decreased appetite and an unintentional ten-pound weight-loss.  Approximately one-month ago Ms. Marcantel began to experience altered bowel habits and lower left quadrant discomfort.  Her bowel movements increased in number and frequency and the character of the stool seemed different.  On two occasions she did note some hematochezia intermixed with her stool which prompted her to be further evaluated by her local physician.  Laboratory tests were reportedly remarkable for iron-deficiency anemia, however, outside records do not reveal what her hemoglobin was at the time of initial presentation.  Further evaluation was then recommended with an EGD and colonoscopy, both of which were performed at the outside medical facility on September 1, 2010.  EGD was remarkable for Barrett's esophagus as well as a hiatal hernia.  Colonoscopy revealed a near obstructing bulky friable tumor in her proximal descending colon.  The colonoscope could not pass safely upstream beyond the tumor.  An ink spot was injected just below the lesion to mark it.  Biopsies were reportedly consistent with invasive, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Further imaging was then obtained with a CT-scan on September 10, 2010, which confirmed the bulky tumor in the descending colon which was measured to be approximately 8 x 8-cm; no regional adenopathy was noted.  Incidentally noted was a nodule in the right adrenal gland as well as a small area of hypervascularity within the liver.  An MRI was then obtained to further evaluate these incidental findings.  On MRI, the right adrenal nodule was measured to be 1.9-cm in size, and was felt to be consistent with an adrenal adenoma.  The hypervascularity noted within the liver was measured to be 9-mm in the posterior segment of the right lobe.  Although this finding was possibly felt to be consistent with an hemangioma, the radiologist could not rule-out metastasis.  Laboratory studies were also obtained, and were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia.  Liver function and renal function tests were within limits of normal, and CEA was measured to be 1.1. Ms. Marcantel has requested outside referral for surgical intervention.
The colonoscopy performed on September 1, 2010, was the first colonoscopy the patient has ever undergone.  The quality of the preparation was noted to be adequate, however, as previously mentioned, the operator could not pass the colonoscope safely upstream beyond the tumor.  Regarding further symptoms, Ms. Marcantel denies any nausea, vomiting, or constipation.  She denies any personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease.  She states that her father did have a history of prostate cancer, and at age 79 was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer and subsequently two-months after diagnosis.
