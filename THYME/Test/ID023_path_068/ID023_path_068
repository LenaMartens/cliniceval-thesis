Final Diagnosis
B.  Colon, right, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 9.2 x 4.6 x 1.2 cm flat ulcerated mass in the cecum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present in the form of a pericolonic soft tissue implant.  Multiple (2 of 13) regional lymph nodes are positive for tumor.

A.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
