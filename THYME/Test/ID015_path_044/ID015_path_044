Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring cell features is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.0 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm) located 15.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria to focally involve the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The terminal ileum and appendix are unremarkable.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  One (of 18) regional lymph node is focally positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  No extranodal extension is identified.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1a] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
