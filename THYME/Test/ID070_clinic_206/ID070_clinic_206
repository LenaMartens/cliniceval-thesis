#1 Rectal cancer
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Stubbs who also met with Mr. Tyler and his wife.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, CT abdomen and pelvis, rectal ultrasound, and I asked them to locate a stage,FNA if indicated, and tattoo below the lesion if feasible.  Also scheduled for Colon and Rectal Surgery consultation, and I have added Medical and Radiation Oncology.  Because of his young age, we will get immunohistochemical staining on the tissue.  Patient may need to see Genetics if IHC is positive.  Patient is okay anesthesia in my estimation with no cardiopulmonary issues and on no cardiopulmonary medications.
