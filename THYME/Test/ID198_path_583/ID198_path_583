Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, rectum, anus, low anterior resection and endoanal mucosal resection:  Residual moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features forming a 3.1 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm ulcerative mass in the rectum, located 1.9 cm from distal margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The radial resection margin is negative for tumor by 0.1 cm.  Multiple (2 of 8) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N1] (7th edition, 2010) Tumor regression grade  2 (of 3).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid, rectum, endoanal mucosal resection"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 20.5 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  The radial margin is inked.  A 3.1 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 1.0 cm from the dentate line, 1.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 0.1 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Radial margin is submitted perpendicularly.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HATTEN.



Addendum Diagnosis
In addition to the two nodes with metastases, there are two additional nodes with extravasated mucin and macrophages consistent with treated tumor metastases.
