#1 Status-post resection of a T4, N1 (1 of 51) sigmoid adenocarcinoma with direct invasion into the bladder and perforation, with residual microscopic disease left near radial margin
Mrs. Mann is a pleasant 64 year-old female from Tennessee with a resected perforated sigmoid cancer with invasion into the bladder.
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Lee Guyer's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Janie Wilhelm, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
We would recommend chemotherapy in this situation.  Mrs. Mann will return in the outpatient seeing to discuss treatment recommendations.  At that time she will undergo a baseline CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, a chest x-ray, and a postoperative operation with Dr. Guyer.  She has verbalized understanding and is agreeable to the plan.   I have emphasized to her that she is to make contact with a local medical oncologist to help insure continuity of care and also set herself up with a primary-care provider.  She has verbalized understanding and is agreeable.

Mrs. Mann is a very pleasant 64 year-old female from Tennessee.
1.  July 2010 - Presented after a four-year history of progressive constipation, lower abdominal cramping,  intermittent bright-red blood per rectum, and progressive 75 pound weight-loss (160 pounds to 89 pounds).
2.  July 15, 2010 - Referred to Pacific Memorial Hospital.  Hemoglobin at 4.8, transfused appropriately.  CT imaging showing approximately a 10-cm circumferential mass in the proximal sigmoid with regional lymphadenopathy partially obstructing the left ureter causing hydronephrosis.  There was a suspicious right adrenal nodule 2.2-cm in size and subcentimeter liver lesions, indeterminate.
3.  July 19, 2010 - Flexible sigmoidoscopy identifying an obstructing sigmoid mass at approximately 35 cm.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
4.  July 21, 2010 - Taken by Dr. Guyer and Dr. Pat Williams for a joint resection including resection of a perforated sigmoid colon cancer with adherence to the bladder.  Total abdominal colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomoses and diverting loop ileostomy.  Bilateral external uretal stent placement and primary repair of the laceration of the left external iliac vein and anastomosis of the distal left external iliac vein with revision of the left external iliac artery repair with reversed right grade saphenous vein interposition graft.  Per operative note, there was a large obstructing sigmoid cancer identified that had serosal tears in it and area of actual perforation into the retroperitoneum and involving the bladder.  There was a  microscopic as positive radial margin near the bladder, but there was no evidence of gross residual disease. There was also approximately a liter to a liter and one-half of feculent material removed from the bladder during the procedure.  Surgical pathology noted a Grade 3 adenocarcinoma forming 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.5-cm ulcerative and annular mass in the sigmoid invading through the muscularis propria and visceral peritoneum and extending to abut the radial margin in the region of the ureter with one of 51 regional positive lymph nodes.
5. Postoperatively developed SIRS with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema versus sepsis versus acute lung injury.
Mrs. Mann is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
