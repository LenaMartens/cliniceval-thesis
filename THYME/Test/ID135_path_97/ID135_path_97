Final Diagnosis
A.  Diaphragm, right nodule, biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Tina M. Link, M.D.

B.  Rectum, vagina, bladder, excision:  Recurrent grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin, forming a 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.5 cm ill-defined mass involving the region of the vaginal apex. Tumor extends to involve the initial vesical soft tissue margin, and 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock vaginal margins. Angiolymphatic invasion is present.

C.  Pelvic margin, deep lateral, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Pelvic margin, deep inferior, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

E.  Urinary bladder, posterior margins, biopsy:  Portion of bladder wall negative for tumor. 

F.  Urinary bladder, anterior margins, biopsy:  Portion of bladder wall negative for tumor.

G.  Vaginal cuff, margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SMITH.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""deep lateral pelvic margin"" is a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted.  Grossed by SMITH.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""deep inferior pelvic margin"" is a 3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9 cm portion of tan-red tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted.  Grossed by SMITH.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""posterior bladder margins"" is a 3.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm portion of tan-red tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted.  Grossed by SMITH.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""anterior bladder margins"" is a 3.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm portion of tan-red tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted.  Grossed by SMITH.
