Final Diagnosis
A.	Rectosigmoid colon, resection:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma  forming a 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm mass in the peri-rectal adipose tissues.  Radial margin of resection free of tumor by 0.3 cm.  Proximal and distal mucosal margins are negative for tumor.

B.	Rectosigmoid proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.	Rectosigmoid distal anastomotic ring, excision:	Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled sigmoid colon and portion of rectum stitch on distal is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 17.4 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon. Anus is not present.  A 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm external soft tissue mass is present within the pericolonic fat, 4.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 0.3 cm from the radial margin. Grossly, the mass is confined to the muscle and pericolonic fat.   Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by NICHOLS.

B.	Received fresh labeled colon and rectum proximal anastomotic rings is a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm portion of annular ring of bowel mucosa.  Grossly the specimen is unremarkable.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by NICHOLS.

C.  Received fresh labeled colon and rectum distal anastomotic rings is a 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm portion of annular ring of bowel mucosa.  Grossly the the specimen is unremarkable.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by NICHOLS.
	




Addendum Diagnosis
Five perirectal lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma.
