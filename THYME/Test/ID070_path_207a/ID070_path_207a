Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a mass (2.8 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm).  The tumor invades into but not through the muscularis propria.  A tumor implant is identified in the pericolonic fat.  Actin and VVG support the diagnosis.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (15) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N1c with TD (tumor deposit)] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Kidney, right, partial nephrectomy:  Grade 2 (of 4) chromophobe renal cell carcinoma forms a mass (2.3 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm).  The surgical margins are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material, [AJCC pT1a] (7th edition, 2010).

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in NKQQ RiwqPzfy.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
