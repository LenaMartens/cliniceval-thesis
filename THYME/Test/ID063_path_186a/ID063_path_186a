Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a ulcerated exophytic mass (5.0 x 3.4 x 0.6 cm) in the rectum, located 2.0 cm from the distal margin.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (7 of 30) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N2] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Rectosigmoid, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

D.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (5.5 x 3.2 x 0.4 cm) located in the cecum, 6.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (of 57) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The appendix is histologically unremarkable.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of rectum and sigmoid colon"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 30.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 5.0 x 3.4 x 0.6 cm ulcerated exophytic mass is present within the rectum, 2.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 1.8 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BARRETT.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""colon and rectum, proximal anastomotic ring"" is a 2.1 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm portion of grossly unremarkable anastomotic mucosal ring with suture material.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by KAUTZ.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""colon and rectum, distal anastomotic ring"" is a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm portion of grossly unremarkable anastomotic mucosal ring with suture material.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by KAUTZ.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 6.5 cm of terminal ileum, 23.0 cm of colon, and an 8.5 x 0.8 cm appendix.  A 5.5 x 3.2 x 0.4 cm ulcerated mass is present within the cecum, 6.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 8.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SCOTT
