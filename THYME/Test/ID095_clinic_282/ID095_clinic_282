#1 Colonic adenocarcinoma diffusely involving liver with residual disease present
At this juncture, unfortunately, Mr. Ley is faced with diffuse hepatic metastases related to his colon primary adenocarcinoma.  He has successfully undergone resection of the primary tumor, but unfortunately, we are faced with residual disease within the liver.
We reviewed the situation in detail with the patient, his spouse, and also with the patient's accompanying son who took prodigious notes in the presence of both Dr. Lowrie and I independently.  We reviewed that the patient's chronic renal failure is a significant impediment to the most aggressive approach that would be preferred in treating metastatic colon; that is, regimens containing oxaliplatin.  We reviewed also that the patient's comorbidities and poor performance status would increase the risks of side-effects from treatment and that no treatment would be curative but would be palliative.
We discussed this within the context of the patient's preferences, and the outcome of these discussions on the whole resulted in the determination that the patient is feeling it most reasonable to proceed primarily with symptomatic care and not undertake aggressive treatment-related to his metastatic cancer.
We discussed that if the patient does very well in his convalescence period and becomes ambulatory and is feeling much better, consideration of palliative chemotherapy could be undertaken.  In this particular situation, my thinking would be to start, if desired by the patient under these circumstances, with capecitabine - as I believe that this is something that might have potential to be more reasonably tolerated than other approaches overall.  We did discuss, however, that this is not a requirement, that it is something the patient could consider if he, upon reflection, decides that he wishes to treat his cancer actively rather than pursue a supportive care and hospice-type approach.
We also spent a considerable amount of time discussing the home situation.  In particular, the patient and his wife are living autonomously in a home, and one has the sense that they may both be required to maintain their autonomy.  This will be particularly important to attend to in that any decline in one may precipitate a decline in the other, and we reviewed that in decision-making related to therapies for Mr. Ley, care must be taken to assure that his wife does well additionally.  We also reviewed that the current situation may potentially precipitate a rethinking of their living situation within the context of what might be expected as the situation matures with Mr. Ley's cancer.  Additionally, we discussed the potential merits of involvement of hospice support, and I addressed very specific questions related to expectations for symptoms that might arise as the patient's cancer progresses.
All of the above was discussed in a very thoughtful manner with the patient, his wife, and son with many questions asked and answered, especially on the part of the patient's son.  Again, I had the impression that the patient would like a supportive approach with emphasis on symptomatic management rather than an aggressive approach using systemic chemotherapy.

Mr. Watts Ley is a delightful 89-year-old hard-of-hearing gentleman recently found to have advanced colon adenocarcinoma who has undertaken resection of a cecal primary tumor but was found to have extensive hepatic metastases at surgery that could not be resected.  The patient has a prior history of comorbidity including coronary artery disease with direct interventions to the heart as recently as this past September.  He has also had peripheral vascular disease and claudication and also significant chronic renal insufficiency with most recent creatinine determinations consistently over 3-mg/dL.
Most recently, the patient was found to have a cecal mass.  Resection was undertaken by Dr. Thompson with, unfortunately, multiple metastases found at surgery, albeit not so apparent on noncontrast CT-scan which was required because of the patient's chronic renal failure.  The patient now presents to us for an opinion with regard to options for palliative therapy.
