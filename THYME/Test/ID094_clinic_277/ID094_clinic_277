#1 Metastatic rectal cancer
This disease was diagnosed in August of 2009 and was felt to not be resectable at the time of diagnosis.  Liver metastases were present at the time, Mr. Klein received neoadjuvant chemoradiation using 5-FU directed towards the primary tumor in order to render it resectable.  This was completed in October of 2009.  A repeat CT-scan at the time revealed an increase in the size and number of metastases.  According to the records, Mr. Klein was started on chemotherapy using FOLFOX.  I have seen five documented doses that he has received so far in the records.  After three doses, a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a questionable mild increase in size and number of some of the hepatic metastases.  Avastin was therefore added to the FOLFOX for the most recent two cycles.  It is felt that there was slight progression of disease. However, I am also a little hesitant to call this progression of disease after only three cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  The answer to this question would obviously be important since if there is progression of disease one should change the chemotherapy from FOLFOX plus Avastin, e.g. FOLFIRI.  I have discussed this problem with several of my colleagues from the GI group
I have discussed with Mr. Klein and his father that surgery is the only curative modality, even in metastatic colon cancer and have therefore asked Drs. Boivin and Hicks from Liver Surgery and Colorectal Surgery about their opinion regarding resectability.  In discussion with both colleagues, they felt that a resection might be a reasonable option.
In order to schedule surgery, Mr. Klein would need to be off Avastin for at least six-weeks.  Since his most recent dose of Avastin was on 1/4/2010, the earliest possible date for surgery would be 2/8/2010.  This would mean one more dose of FOLFOX  or FOLFIRI (1/18/2010).  I suggest that Mr Klein has a CT-scan around 1/31 to assure a response and for restaging.  These images should be sent to Buchanan for evaluation by Marion Boivin and Houston.  Hopefully, surgical resection can take place during the week of 2/8 or 2/15.  Should re-imaging show progression of disease, I would recommend further cycles with FOLFIRI, with or without Cetuximab.
I have also discussed with Mr. Klein that since his tumor his KRAS wild-type the administration of Erbitux might add potential benefit.  This seems most relevant in the adjuvant setting.
I will follow-up with Mr. Klein prior to the planned surgery, at the time of restaging in my clinic.

#1 Metastatic rectal cancer

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Klein is a 33-year-old man from Skaneateles Falls who is coming to Shorewood Memorial Hospital for a second opinion regarding treatment of his metastatic rectal cancer. His oncologic history is as follows:
1.  In August of 2009, he noticed massive amounts of blood in his stool.  A CT on October 16, 2009, showed a 2.3- x 2-cm soft-tissue mass in the right-side of the pelvis adjacent to the external iliac vessels.  In the liver, there were three low-density foci.  A colonoscopy showed a rectal mass very close to the anal verge.  Biopsy slides were reviewed here at the Blue Health Center Denham Springs.  The report describes moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
2.  A PET scan on August 25, 2009, revealed a 2-cm right iliac lymph node.  Two foci of trace uptake were seen within the liver.  The largest liver lesion had a maximal SUV of 7.4 and the right iliac lymph node had a maximal SUV of 5.2.  The second rectosigmoid colon was also PET avid with a maximum of 7.9.  A 1.8- x 1-cm left pelvic lymph node was also PET avid having a maximal SUV of 8.3.
3.  It was decided to give neoadjuvant chemoradiation to the rectum in order to improve the chance of resectability of the primary lesion.  Chemoradiation using 5-FU was performed from September 2, 2009, through October 13, 2009.
4.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis on October 27, 2009, revealed a decrease in the size of the right pelvic lymph node but increase in size of two masses within the liver with additional new masses.
5.  Start of FOLFOX chemotherapy on November 9, 2009.  Doses were administered on November 9, November 23, December 7, December 21, and January 4.  The records here are not synchronous with the patient's history.  The patient had told me that he has received three cycles of FOLFOX so far.  Clearly the records demonstrate otherwise.  The last two doses were administered in conjunction with bevacizumab.
6.  December 18, 2009:  After three doses of FOLFOX, a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed  mildy progressive liver disease with slight increase  in size and number of the liver lesions. The largest mass in the anterior segment right hepatic lobe measures 2.4-cm in greatest length in December compared to 2.1-cm previously. A new 4-mm lesion is seen in the inferior right hepatic lobe. Approximately 8 additional hepatic lesions are identified throughout the liver.
7.  December 27, 2009:  Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed that the area of local disease in the rectum is barely discernable at this point.  A slightly eroded scar was present at the site of the previously identified cancer.  The pathology report does not describe any malignant cells.
Mr. Klein now comes to Shorewood Memorial Hospital to discuss further treatment.  He states that he has no symptoms, that he feels strong, that he continues exercising, and denies weight-loss.
