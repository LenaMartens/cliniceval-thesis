We are awaiting biopsies to confirm whether this is adenocarcinoma.  This will also help for deciding on extent of invasion.  Further, patient will undergo a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis evaluating for regional spread and metastasis.  He will also undergo testing for CEA for prognosis.  He has a history of stable nodules in the lung.  He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking, stopped about 25 years ago.  We will order a chest x-ray, PA and lateral, and he will also be seen by one of our colorectal surgery colleagues.  I will see the patient back after this workup.

Ascending colon mass.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

This is a 76-year-old white male being evaluated for a colon mass.  Patient underwent a colonoscopy yesterday for anemia which showed a friable 3- to 4-cm cauliflower-like mass in the ascending colon.  Biopsies were done, and they are currently pending.  There is a concern for colon cancer.
Patient has had routine colonoscopy screenings here as well as locally.  In 2002 he had a colonoscopy which showed multiple polyps.  He had 12-mm and 4- to 5-mm polyps in the transverse colon, and these were tubulovillous adenomas with low-grade dysplasia.  He also had a TA in the descending colon and a-1-cm rectal polyp which was a hyperplastic polyp.  These were all removed.  A year later he had another colonoscopy.  At that time he was noted to have a 3-mm cecal polyp; this was a tubular adenoma low-grade dysplasia.  He was also found to have a 5-mm rectal polyp which was a hyperplastic polyp.  Once again these were removed.  He had a colonoscopy done locally in 2005 which by the patient showed polyps which were also removed.  Patient had known anemia.  In November 2009 his hemoglobin was 11.9, and his MCV was 81.2.  About three-to-four weeks prior, patient presented to urgent care with shortness-of-breath and weakness, at that time was found to have a hemoglobin of 6.6, and he was transfused 2 units PRBCs.  Currently his hemoglobin is 9.2.  His MCV is 77.5.  Workup of this revealed the mass as reported above.  The biopsies are pending at this time.
The patient has a significant cardiovascular history.  He has had an endovascular repair of an asymptomatic abdominal aneurysm complicated by an endoleak; however, he has continued to be stable.  His IMA is occluded.   It has been a year-and-a-half since he had his AAA repair with an endothelial stent, but he has active follow-up by Cardiovascular as well as the Vascular Service.  His EKG shows no acute changes.  He is not having unstable anginal symptoms.  His echocardiogram shows normal LV size and function.  He has had a recent stress test which has been negative for ischemia.  He has good exertional capacity.  His breathing is much improved, and his pulmonary function tests are basically unchanged from before.  He also has a history of type-2 diabetes on Metformin; however, he has good control on this.  His last HbA1c was 7.  Currently the patient reports that he is doing well and denies any change in his bowel habits.  He reports that his weight has been stable at least for one-year.  He denies any bright-red blood per rectum, melena.  He denies any fevers, chills, or abdominal discomfort.
