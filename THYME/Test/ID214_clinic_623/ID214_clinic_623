Ms. Dossett is a 37-year-old Caucasian lady coming in to the GI Neoplasia Clinic with newly-diagnosed rectal carcinoma.  The patient's symptoms have started late in May with hematochezia.  Initially, she noticed only streak of blood in her stool.  Later, it has progressed and now she notices blood with each bowel movement.  She also noticed a change in her bowel habits as well as the stool calibers since the middle of summer.  Her stools are  narrow in caliber  and mostly semisolid.  Her bowel frequency has increased to four to six bowel movements per day.  Since the end of June, she has some discomfort occasionally pain in her rectum with bowel movement.  She was initially seen by her primary-care physician in June 20101 who referred her to a gastroenterologist (  Dr. Hungerford) for colonoscopy.  She had her colonoscopy at the P   in Gretna.  The patient reports, she was found to have a-1.6-cm rectal mass lesion close to her internal sphincter. Subsequently she had a CT of her abdomen, pelvis, and chest done at the Saint Bernards Behavioral Memorial Hospital in Lafayette for staging workup .  Her CT studies showed no metastatic disease, but incidentally found to have a ? mucocele of her appendix. She was referred to Traverse City initially where she saw a surgeon by the name Dr. Pleasants who has recommended surgical resection and a colostomy.   She subsequently went to McHenry County Hospital in Arrington and saw Dr. Keister for a second opinion.  She had a rectal ultrasound done at the McHenry County Hospital, and the patient reports her tumor was T1 or T2 in size.  Dr. Keister at Ferguson clinic also concurred with Dr. Thompson recommendations.
Patient coming to Presbyterian Clinic today to learn more about other treatment options apart from the conventional surgical resection and a colostomy.
She does not have any history of nausea, vomiting, or decreased appetite.  She did lose 5 pounds in the last couple of weeks which she attributed to her anxiety after coming to know about her rectal cancer.  Denies any constitutional symptoms including fevers, chills, fatigue, and night sweats.
