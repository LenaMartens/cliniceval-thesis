Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, low anterior resection:  Moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm ulcerated mass in the rectum.  Tumor invades the submucosa.  The distal mucosal resection margin is involved by tumor (see part C for completion abdominal perineal resection).  The tumor extends to within 2.2 cm of the radial resection margin.  Multiple (18) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;  hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:  The endometrium shows simple hyperplasia with marked atypia.  Multiple (3) benign endometrial polyps (2.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm, 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm) are identified.  There are multiple (1 submucosal, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension; 5 intramural, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium.  The cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries are without diagnostic abnormality.

MIB-1 and p53 were performed on sections of the endometrium, and show partial but not complete positivity in the atypical glands supporting the diagnosis of simple hyperplasia with marked atypia.

C.  Rectum and anus,  completion abdominal perineal resection:  Residual moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm ulcerated mass in the lower rectum.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 1.3 cm of the radial resection margin.  The anal skin margin is negative (free by 4.2 cm).  Regional lymph nodes are not identified.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT2] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 30.3 cm in length portion of rectum.  A 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, at the distal mucosal margin (adjacent to the staple line), and 2.2 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple (31) potential lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  There are also multiple (6) diverticula.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MICHAEL.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 130.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix.  The uterine serosa is smooth but there are multiple (3) tiny (less than 0.1 cm) nodules in the uterine cul de sac.  The endometrium has multiple (3) endometrial polyps (2.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm, 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm).  There are multiple (1 submucosal, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension; 5 intramural, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium.  There is a 2.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm right ovary with a solid cut surface and a 5.7 x 0.8 cm right fallopian tube which is unremarkable.  There is a 2.6 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm left ovary with a solid cut surface and 6.4 x 0.6 cm left fallopian tube which has a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm calcified nodule in the fimbria.   Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MICHAEL.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""anus and lower rectum"" is the completion abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 5.7 cm in length portion of lower rectum and anus.  There is a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm ulcerative mass within the lower rectum present at the proximal margin (adjacent to the staple line), 0.5 cm from the dentate line, 4.2 cm from the distal anal skin margin, and 1.3 cm from the radial margin.  Lymph nodes are not identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MICHAEL.
