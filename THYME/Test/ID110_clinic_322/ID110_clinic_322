See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Ross who also met with Mr. Freese and his wife.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient is scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, colon and rectal surgery (Dr. Collins specifically).  We will get his outside slides read here and outside CT abdomen and pelvis from January 2010 reviewed here.  I have ordered Cardiology for okay anesthesia with the patient's history of diabetes, AFib, hypertension, and obesity.
I spent 60 minutes with Mr. Freese discussing all of the above, answering all questions.

#1 Sigmoid colon cancer
Mr. Freese is a 70-year-old male who noted bright-red bleeding per rectum.  He has a history of colonic polyps, assumed tubular adenomas removed elsewhere in 2002 and 2005.  Colonoscopy on January 7, 2010, was performed on the outside, and a likely malignant tumor in the sigmoid colon was noted and biopsied.  The rest of the colon was essentially normal.  The mass itself was approximately 3-cm in size, and the area just distal to the lesion was tattooed.  Outside pathology showed invasive moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma.  A CT-scan at-home in early January showed focal thickening within the sigmoid colon with mild pericolonic infiltration of the mesenteric fat.  No enlarged adjacent lymph nodes noted, and liver was normal.  Patient tells me that he saw a colon and rectal surgeon at the Kessel Group who tattooed the area more during flexible sigmoidoscopy.  I do not have that report.  Patient now comes to Hudson and would like surgery by Colon and Rectal Surgery here.
