Final Diagnosis
A.	Small bowel and adjacent left peri-common iliac lymph node, resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a mass (2.3 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm) adjacent to the small bowel.

B.	Lymph nodes, left common iliac, biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming multiple (2) nodules (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm).

C.	Sigmoid, rectum and anus, abdominoperineal resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.7 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm mass in the perirectal soft tissue near the anastomosis.  Multiple (3) nodules (0.4 cm in greatest dimension) in the perirectal soft tissue are also involved by carcinoma.  The colonic mucosa is uninvolved.  Multiple (10) regional lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma.

D.	Bone and soft tissue, coccygeal region, excision:  Fibromuscular tissue.  Negative for tumor.  There is an attached portion of the coccyx bone identified.

E.	Soft tissue, abdominal wound nodule, excision:  Fat necrosis and fibrosis forming a nodule (2.5 x 1.9 x 0.9 cm).

F.	Liver, right lobe, wedge resection:  Multinodular foreign body granulomatous reaction with zones of necrosis over an area measuring 3.2 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm); negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Benjy T. Hillier, M.D.

G.	Small bowel, resection:  Small bowel mucosa without diagnostic abnormality.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled ""left peri common iliac lymph node, portion mall bowel, posterior down"" is a 4.3 cm portion of small bowel with an adjacent lymph node (2.3 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm).  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS.

B.	Received fresh labeled ""left common iliac nodes"" are multiple (2) lymph nodes (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm).  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS.

C.	Received fresh labeled portion sigmoid, rectum, anus is a 31.7 cm segment of sigmoid, rectum and anus (abdominoperineal resection).  There is an anastomosis in the rectum located 0.8 cm proximal to the dentate line and 3.7 cm from the anal skin margin.  In the region of the anastomosis, there is a soft tissue mass (3.7 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm).  Multiple (20) potential lymph nodes are identified.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS.

D.	Received fresh labeled ""soft tissue, portion coccyx"" is a 3.5 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm unoriented portion of soft tissue and portion of coccyx bone (1.3 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm).  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS.

E.	Received fresh labeled ""abdominal wound nodule"" is a 3.2 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm portion of soft tissue with a 2.5 x 1.9 x 0.9 cm yellow mass which grossly looks like fat necrosis.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS. 

F.	Received fresh labeled ""right lobe liver"" is an 11.77 gram, 4.7 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm liver wedge resection.  A 3.2 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm yellow, soft, necrotic-looking mass with embedded suture, is present 0.2 cm from the surgical resection margin.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PAPPAS.

G.	Received fresh labeled ""portion small bowel"" is a 13.3 cm segment of small bowel.  There is luminal narrowing in the mid portion of the specimen.  A representative section is submitted. Grossed by PAPPAS. 



Frozen Sect-Intraop
F.	Liver, right lobe, partial hepatectomy:  Foreign body granulomatous reaction, consistent with site of previous surgery.  Rare atypical cells present.

Holdover to rule out recurrent tumor.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Benjy T. Hillier, M.D. 



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Maggie Davis, CNP, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded rectal tissue (block C2).  Upon completion, results will be available in KYDW BvrySudq.


Internal Comments
8/23/2010 6 molgen recuts to MG for k-ras mutation analysis at request of Maggie Davis, CNP/kennedy
