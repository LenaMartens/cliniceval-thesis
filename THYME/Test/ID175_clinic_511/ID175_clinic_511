#1 Newly-diagnosed colon cancer
I reviewed these findings with Mr. Miller and his son and friend.  We went over his current clinical findings.  He needs further diagnostic studies and then evaluation by Colorectal Surgery and General Surgery.  We will try to coordinate this.  I will go ahead and get PET scan and ECG.  I will see him back with results.
#2 Diabetes mellitus, insulin-requiring
He needs to be seen by Diabetes Clinic as soon as possible.  We will try to arrange this for today.  We will check hemoglobin A1c.
#3 Seizure disorder, on Dilantin
We will go ahead and try to check Dilantin level.

#1 Newly-diagnosed colon cancer
Mr. Miller is seen for an opinion regarding his newly-diagnosed colon cancer.  The patient was in his usual state of health but had some fainting spells in April.  He was seen by his local physician and found to be anemic with a hemoglobin below 8.  He was transfused 3 units.  He had a colonoscopy on April 4, 2010, and this showed a large polypoid growth approximately 120 cm from the anal verge.  Biopsies revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (slides not available for review).  He underwent CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on April 18 which showed a small right pleural effusion and a possible density in the right lobe of the liver as well as the descending colon lesion.  MRI of the liver on April 25 showed multiple focal densities in the liver suspicious for metastases.
The patient was offered further surgery and came here for another opinion.  He is feeling better since his transfusions.  He is not having any dizziness.  he denies any cardiac symptoms.  He denies any change in his bowel habits.  He is not having any abdominal pain.  He has had no weight-loss.
#2 Type-2 diabetes, insulin-requiring
The patient has been on insulin for the past approximately ten years.  Unfortunately, he did not bring any of his medication with him to the Nova House Hospital.  He was hoping to get prescriptions for his insulin while he is here.  He denies any urinary symptoms at this point.  His blood glucose yesterday was over 400.
#3 History of seizure disorder
He has been on Dilantin for about five years.  No etiology for the seizures was ever determined.
