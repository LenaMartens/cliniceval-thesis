This is a 78-year-old gentleman presenting for the below concerns:
#1 Probable rectal cancer
Even though the colonoscopy report suggests this is one localized to the anus, given the histology being adenocarcinoma this is most likely consistent with rectal adenocarcinoma.  We will recommend the following:
1.  Review outside pathology and CT-scan.
2.  We will perform an endorectal ultrasound for further staging purposes.
3.  Routine labs and EKG.
4.  We will have him return to meet with us and Surgery once these tests are complete.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at PVCC.

This is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a prior history of colon polyps.  He is status-post right hemicolectomy presenting for the below concerns:
#1 Rectal cancer
During a routine colonoscopy performed approximately 17 to 18 years ago polyps were noted.  Patient denied any history of cancer.  He did undergo a right hemicolectomy at that time.  He underwent intermediate surveillance.  He is unsure if he had recurrent polyps between now and recent, however he does have reports of 5-mm polyps in the transverse colon and descending colon that were fairly benign on a colonoscopy in 2007.  He had been feeling well up until approximately two-months ago where he developed constipation and noting he would have a bowel movement every two days with change in stool caliber, sensation of incomplete evacuation often having to use digital maneuvers to evacuate stool.  This was associated with dysgeusia and a perirectal pain and swelling.  He noted that there is a prominent mass that would extrude from his anus, and he would have to manually push it back in when he would stand or when he would have a bowel movement.  He also notes fatigue during this time, does not note any weight-loss.  These issues prompted him to obtain a colonoscopy at his home in Minnesota.  Colonoscopy on the 5th of April 2010 showed a posterior anal mass that was ulcerated and approximately 2-cm in size.  Of note, it did say it was an anal mass.  No mention of the distance from the anal verge to this mass or how far up it went in the report available for our review.  There were also several 7- to 8-mm sessile transverse colon polyps that were removed with snare cautery.  Biopsies of the transverse colon lesions were tubular adenomas, and this "post anal mass" was consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma that is moderately differentiated in the background of villous adenomatous features.  He underwent a CT of his chest, abdomen, pelvis that was notable for a soft-tissue fullness at the anal verge and no evidence of distant metastases.
He had already met with the surgeon in Minnesota and options discussed included going straight for APR, however patient requested a second opinion here at Kilman.

Extremities:  No edema.Abdomen:  Soft, nontender abdomen.  Normal active bowel sounds.  Midline surgical scars present.Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.Thyroid:  Normal to palpation.Eyes:  Scleral anicteric.General:  No acute distress.Rectum:  There is a erythematous exophytic lesion extruding from the anus.  It is approximately 2- to 3-cm.  It is nontender.  Able to insert a finger, however I am unable to feel the base of the mass.  This is differential for the appearance that this could be a very large hemorrhoid that is not thrombosed versus some prolapse secondary to a mass effect from this malignancy versus extension of the mass itself.Skin:  No rashes.Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, gallops.Lymph:  There is no cervical, pre- or postauricular, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal adenopathy.Mental:  Mood is appropriate.  Thought process is linear.
