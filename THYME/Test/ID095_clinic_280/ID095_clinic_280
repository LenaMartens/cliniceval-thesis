Mr. Ley is a 89-year-old gentleman who was seen in the Hamilton University Medical Center with Dr. Carr the middle of December 2009.  His work-up for Dyspnea and Claudication revealed a cecal and  liver mass consistent with Metastatic Colon Cancer.  Seen with Dr. Sykes at that time. He wasn't sure he wanted surgery at that point due to his age and medical risks, but decided to pursue surgery.  Dr. Thompson was contacted and felt a combined laparoscopic procedure was feasible.  Now returns for surgery. Seen with Dr. Sykes and Dr. Thompson who reviewed surgery.
