Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum and anus, resection:  Poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 7.3 x 3.1 x 1.2 cm ulcerative annular mass in the proximal rectum, 9.2 cm from the dentate line.  Tumor focally penetrates the visceral peritoneum and extends to within 0.1 cm of the left lateral radial resection margin.  Multiple (16 of 32) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  In addition, multiple peritumoral deposits are present within the pericolonic fat.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT4aN2b] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and anus"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 33.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 6.5 x 1.7 cm portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked.  A 4.5 x 3.1 x 1.2 cm ulcerative annular mass extending over a length of 4.5 cm in the proximal rectum. There is a 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm submucosal nodule, 1.4 cm extending proximally from the main mass that represents possible extension of the mass, up to 7.3 cm in length.  The mass is 9.2 cm from the dentate line, 19.5 cm from proximal mucosal margin, 11.3 cm from anal skin, and 0.2 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Radial margin submitted perpendicular.  Grossed by ESTES.
