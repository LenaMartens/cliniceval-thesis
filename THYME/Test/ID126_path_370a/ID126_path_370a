Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, posterior margin, excision:  Fibroconnective tissue and skeletal muscle with chronic inflammation, histiocytes, and hemosiderin deposition; negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Cory Stone M.D.

B.  Colon, rectosigmoid, abdominal perineal resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, annular mass (9.2 x 8.4 x 1.4 cm) located in the rectum, 17.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  The posterior radial margin is positive for adenocarcinoma (additional margins submitted and reported separately, see below).  Multiple (9 of 38) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. [AJCC, 7th edition; pT3N2bMX]

C.  Rectum, anterior margin, biopsy:  Positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

D.  Rectum, right margin, biopsy:  Granulation tissue, negative for tumor.

E.  Rectum, anterior margin #2, biopsy:  Granulation tissue, negative for tumor.

F.  Rectum, posterior margin #2, biopsy:  Positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

G.  Rectum, right margin #2, biopsy:  Granulation tissue, negative for tumor.

H.  Colon, descending, polypectomy:  Tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
