#1 Descending colon cancer
See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Wells, who also met with Mr. Robinson.  Please see his supervisory note.  Mr. Robinson was seen by a cardiologist closer to home and had a recent heart catheterization February 23, 2010.  A narrative is provided, but I did not see the report.  Mr. Robinson was told by his surgeon that he had an 80% chance of survival post-surgery.  He comes for a second opinion and wonders if there is other treatment that could be done rather than surgery.  Patient is scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, CT abdomen and pelvis, Cardiology consultation, and Colon and Rectal Surgery consultation.  We will get his outside tissue slides.  Patient is not okay anesthesia--pending cardiology clearance.

#1 Colon cancer, descending colon
Mr. Robinson is a 71-year-old male who was found to be anemic by his local provider.  This led to colonoscopy January 27, 2010.  The colonoscopy report states preparation was good, and at 35 cm a mass-like area was noted and biopsied and tattooed.  Colonoscopist made it to the cecum, and the rest of the colon appeared normal.  Outside pathology read the biopsies as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with evidence of invasion.  Mr. Robinson states he had a CT abdomen and pelvis which apparently was negative, but the report is not in outside records and I do not have the CD.  Mr. Robinson has multiple comorbidities, see past history.  This was Mr. Robinson's first and only colonoscopy.
