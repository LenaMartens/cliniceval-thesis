#1 Rectal cancer
Discussed in-depth in Mrs. Camara and her son the evaluation of rectal cancer.  We will start with an endoscopic rectal ultrasound.  We will attempt another colonoscopy as she has not had evaluation of her proximal colon, although I discussed with her this may or may not be able to be performed.  We will have this tattooed.  If the EUS reveals this is located above 10-cm, we will need to obtain a pelvic MRI to assess the mesorectal radial margin so I will tentatively schedule a pelvic MRI.  I discussed with her if we cannot complete the full colonoscopy, there is a chance she may need a CT colonography or hypaque enema, but I will not schedule these at this time.  Discussed she may need neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and radiation based on the test results.  I will see her back with Dr. Hollister later this week following her testing.  She will be going to Enema Prep before her appointment with Dr. Hollister so he can perform a proctoscopy.  We will get a chest x-ray, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, as well as CEA for staging.  Discussed with Mrs. Camara that her children need to undergo colonoscopies starting at age 50.  However, I discussed with her son who accompanies her, as he had polyps at 20, he will need to get those records and discuss with his primary-care provider when it would be appropriate for his children to undergo screening.
#2 Fecal seepage
I have some concerns, even if she has a high rectal cancer, about her having incontinence problems.  I will get a baseline anorectal manometry testing for evaluation.
#3 Accelerated hypertension
This may be whitecoat hypertension.  She just took her antihypertensives in my office.  I will see her back this afternoon to recheck her blood pressure.  If this continues to be elevated, it may be important for us to get six-hour blood pressure monitoring.
#4 PAME
As she has risk factors for coronary artery disease including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, being over age 65 and as she has a low functional status and we cannot have her exercise to see what her tolerance is, we will need to proceed with pharmacological dobutamine stress echocardiogram testing. We will get a baseline EKG first.  This will also evaluate her valves as she has this murmur and lower-extremity edema which may be concerning for congestive heart failure.  I have discussed with her to hold her vitamin E and fish oil at this time during her evaluation.
#5 Glaucoma
Stable.
#6 Obesity
I am not sure whether or not she will be a laparoscopic candidate.
Spent 90 minutes with Mrs. Camara and her son reviewing the plan of care in detail.
Separately, as she has had problems with contrast dye in the past, I will premedicate her with Medrol 12 hours and 2 hours before her CT-scan so as to minimize the risk of a reaction. I do think we should try our best to try to get a CT-scan with contrast if our radiologists feel that this is appropriate for staging.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will:  She asked me to discuss with her the details of what an advance directive is which I did and gave her information.
Code status:  Discussed with Mrs. Camara.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Camara is seen at the request of Dr. Bouknight for evaluation of rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mrs. Camara is a 77-year-old female from Owens Cross Roads Tampa with a six-month history of a change in her bowel habits. Until January 2009 she had really not been to a healthcare provider for many years as she felt she was healthy. She had no prior history of a colonoscopy or other healthcare maintenance care.  She actually went in for evaluation in 2009 as she did not feel well and was found to have severely elevated blood pressure, over 200 systolic, and then began being followed regularly for her blood pressure by a local physician assistant.
In March she went in for evaluation as she developed worsening constipation.  She started taking Benefiber without relief.  She also developed rectal bleeding which had been going on for about a month with bowel movements, and she had a larger episode in March which led her to go in for evaluation of the bleeding.  A digital rectal exam was performed, and there was blood on the glove, and it was recommended she get a diagnostic colonoscopy which was performed on April 9, 2010, by Dr. Bouknight.  A complete colonoscopy was unable to be performed as she was found to have a nearly-obstructing mass located approximately 10-cm from the anal verge. This was biopsied with pathology reviewed here revealing invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  This has not yet been tattooed.  She has no family history of colorectal cancer. She has not had obstructive symptoms. She denies abdominal pain, significant weight-loss, or fatigue. Dr. Bouknight had her start on MiraLAX once-a-day following her colonoscopy which she has been taking, and she has generally been moving her bowels twice-a-day on the medication.  She has not had bleeding since her colonoscopy on April 9th.  She has not had further evaluation for her cancer.  She denies true fecal incontinence.  However, she mentions she has been having some leakage since she has been on the MiraLAX , mostly mucus and occasional brown staining on her underwear.  Prior to the last few months, she had not had leakage problems.
Separately, she informs me she has a cystocele.  She attributes this to occurring after a previous gynecological exam, and she is interested in getting a pessary.  At times the bulge protrudes through the vaginal introitus and is bothersome, but it does not come out with general activities such as walking.  She is mostly here for her rectal cancer but brought this up as well but after further discussion she decided she will see someone locally about a pessary.  She denies urinary incontinence, a history of urinary tract infections, and hematuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Rectal cancer.  Discussed above.
2.  Hypertension.  She is currently on Norvasc and carvedilol and reports generally when she is not in a provider's office this is under better control in the 130s to 140s systolic over 80s diastolic, but when she goes to a provider's office, she has whitecoat hypertension, and it is quite high.
3.  Bilateral pedal edema.  Unclear etiology.  She has not had an echocardiogram.  This has been stable recently.
4.  GERD.  Well-managed with Prilosec.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.  She has been told she has high cholesterol but is just on fish oil.  She has multiple drug allergies and has had problems tolerating medication in the past.  She is not sure what her last values were.
6.  Distant history of scarlet fever as a child.
7.  Glaucoma, currently on drops.
8.  Obesity.  She finds it hard to lose weight as she has limited mobility and a limited ability to exercise.
9.  Anxiety disorder.  She has been on Xanax since January 2009 when she started seeing a provider.  She generally takes this once-a-day.  She has not had problems with depression.  She has problems thinking about things at night which is part of her anxiety and why she thinks she does not always sleep well at night which has been a longstanding problem.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Appendectomy many years ago.

Her father-died of an MI at age 76 and had not had a lot of heart problems prior.  Her mother-died of CHF complications in her early 90s.  She has four sisters and one brother.  Her older sister had a CVA in her 70s.  She has a sister whom at age 40 had coronary artery bypass grafting but had been a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.  She has another sister who is healthy and another sister who had a CVA when she was in her upper 60s.  Her brother is 78 and recently had some type of cardiac surgery, but the details are unknown.  Denies family history of bleeding problems, malignant hyperthermia, or anesthetic reactions.  Of note, her son actually underwent a colonoscopy due to what sounds like intestinal torsion when he was 20 and had a few polyps.  He also had cardiac arrest which they thought was secondary to bowel torsion.  The details are unclear.
