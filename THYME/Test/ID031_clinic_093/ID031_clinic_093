#1 Stage III colon cancer of the right-side
#2 History of subclavian iliac artery stenosis, status-post stents leading to a TIA
#3 History of a radial artery pseudoaneurysm, status-post repair
#4 Mildly elevated white count
I explained the following to the patient and his wife:
Though this colon cancer is unusual in that regional lymph node metastasis is very small and solitary, nonetheless, a node is involved and there is extranodal extension.  Even without the nodal extension, I would have advised adjuvant chemotherapy for six-months.  We discussed the pros and cons of FOLFOX, including side-effects.  They would like therapy and surveillance here. Once the therapy is done, I would advise a colonoscopy in 1-year, the next one being February of 2011.  CAT scan chest, abdomen, and pelvis annually for three to five years, the next one being February of 2011.  We could consider getting one earlier if they would like.  And CEAs every three to six-months for two years then every six-months for the three subsequent years.
I have ordered a port for them.  We discussed the pros and cons of a port versus PICC.  Their first chemotherapy cycle one is scheduled for March 31.  They will see me with labs April 14.  I have put in for weekly CBCs at least for the first cycle or two.  We will be monitoring his white count for any signs of infection, and they will be watching out for those, too.
They expressed understanding appreciation agreement.

Mr. Duran is a 55-year-old man who lives about 45 minutes away with the following oncologic history:
1. Late December screening colonoscopy showed a right-sided polyp of about 5-cm.
2. February 5 he underwent a complex colonoscopy to the cecum after which a polypectomy was done revealing a grade 2 out of 4 adenocarcinoma, T2, with less than 1-mm margins.
3. February 24 underwent right hemicolectomy (Dr. Eckel) revealing no primary tumor.  However, 1 out of 29 lymph nodes showed adenocarcinoma of 3-mm size with extranodal extension.
Patient comes here now for advice on further management.  He has no specific complaints.  Denies diarrhea, fevers, cough, abdominal pain.  Has a good appetite and good energy, though in the last three days he has noted some left lower back discomfort with some tenderness which has improved.
