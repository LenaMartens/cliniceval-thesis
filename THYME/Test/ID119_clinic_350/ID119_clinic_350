Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Selina Fuller's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Jamie Childs, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  Patient has been informed that would recommend approximately four months of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  He has an oncologist back home who he will be consulting with.  Dr. Childs, my supervising physician, will make formal recommendations which will be available in his subsequent supervisory note.

Mr. Conde is a pleasant 67 year-old gentleman from Houston, California.  We are being requested to see him by Dr. Greene surgical service to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Conde's history is as follows.
1.  November 9, 2009 - First ever colonoscopy performed due to six-month history of intermittent hematochezia.  At that time, a lesion was removed from the ascending colon, 20 cm, and rectum.  The ascending colon was a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  Both the 20 cm and the rectal mass were tubulovillous adenomas with high-grade dysplasia.  CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also performed documenting three lesions within the liver which were indeterminate.  CEA was known to be 22.9.
2.  December 8, 2009 - Local provider had a PET performed which noted metabolic uptake in the rectal mass.  There was also mild uptake in the esophagus suggestive of mild esophagitis.  Some evidence of an enlarged lymph node that was PET negative.  Liver was also negative.
3.  December 10, 2009 - EUS performed at-home noting a T4, N1, cancer with no separation between the tumor and the prostate.
3.  January 27, 2010 - Completed chemoradiation therapy receiving infusional 5FU.  Received a total of 5,580 cGy.
4.  February 10, 2010 - Presented to MH for further workup.  CT abdomen and pelvis noting multiple stable liver lesions suspicious for cysts.
5.  February 11, 2010 - Dr. Fuller performed a flexible sigmoidoscopy which noted a mass at 5-6-cm from the anus.  CEA was 47.5.
6.  February 12, 2010 - Ultrasound of the liver noting multiple small hepatic cysts.  Two of the lesions in the right lobe of the liver are benign cavernous hemangiomas.  Also underwent a MRI scan which noted focal thickening at the proximal rectum that does not appear to extend to the prostate.  Diffuse bladder wall thickening suggestive of radiation changes.  Enlarged perirectal lymph node posterior to the right margin of the tumor.
7.  March 9, 2010 - CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis noting stable liver lesions with no new findings.
8.  March 10, 2010 - Dr. Fuller performed low-anterior resection.  At the time of this consultation, no operative report is available.  Pathology of the sigmoid and rectum tissue positive for moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma that extends into the muscularis propria.  The tumor extends within 2.3-cm of the radial resected margin.  Of 30 regional lymph nodes removed, three were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Today, Mr. Conde is one-day postoperative.  He is quite sleepy during this conversation due to his pain medication use.  His daughter is present during this consultation.
