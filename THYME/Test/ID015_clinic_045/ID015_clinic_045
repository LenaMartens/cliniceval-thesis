#1 Stage IIIA, recently-diagnosed, poorly-differentiated colon cancer
Dr. Barta and myself explained to the patient that the patient does have a focus of micrometastasis in one of the lymph nodes.  The prognostic value of micrometastasis is not clearly established, but the patient will fall into the stage of T3, N1a.  We explained to the patient that with surgery alone, there is around a 50% chance of cure.  With adjuvant chemotherapy, there would be an additional 15% to 20% benefit of five-year survival and cure.  We explained to the patient that currently there is no evidence of metastatic disease and that his CEA level was normal.  The patient and family prefer to have the treatment locally at Catawba in Ellison Bay Ohio.  We will contact one of the oncologists there to start therapy.  We explained to the patient that the first-line of therapy would be modified FOLFOX6 regimen.  Side-effects of FOLFOX including peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis were explained to the patient.  The patient will also need a MediPort placed.

The patient is a pleasant 66-year-old white male who was recently-diagnosed to have right-sided colon cancer as follows:
1.  In November 2007, the patient was found to have hepatic flexure polyp that was excised and turned out to be tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  Because the preparation was suboptimal, it was repeated in January 2008 and no more polyps were identified.
2.  As a follow-up for that polyp, the patient underwent a repeat colonoscopy on June 2, 2010, that revealed malignant-appearing ulcerated mass in the proximal transverse colon.  Pathology revealed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell.  The patient underwent surgery that was a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy with intraabdominal omental pedicle flap.  The final pathology showed a 2.0- x 1.8- x 0.4-cm ulcerated mass located 15-cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic and vascular invasion was absent, and the margins were negative for dysplasia; 1 (of 18) resected nodes was positive for micrometastasis with focal tumor size of less than 0.1 cm.  The surgery was on June 10, 2010.
Postoperatively, the patient's pain is well-controlled.  He has not used any narcotics for the last three weeks.  He still has constipation which was a problem before surgery to start with.  There is no nausea, vomiting, no fatigue.  The patient is active and he has regained most of his function as before surgery.  He denies any abdominal pain at the current time, jaundice, change in the color of the urine, and he has no other complaints.
