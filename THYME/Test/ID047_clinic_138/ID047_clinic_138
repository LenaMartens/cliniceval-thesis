#1 Stage IIIB (T3, N2a, M0) adenocarcinoma of the colon
I had the discussion regarding adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer and stated that has been shown to improve disease-free survival as well as overall survival in patients with stage III colon cancer.  I did explain our preferred regimen is FOLFOX and explained the details of FOLFOX with oxaliplatin given on day one and 5-FU given day one as well as the infusion of the pump for days one and two.  This is given every two-weeks for a total of 12 cycles.  I did go over the potential side-effects of 5-FU to include but not limited to nausea, vomiting, hand-foot syndrome, mouth sores, and main side-effects of oxaliplatin which include but not limited to acute and chronic sensory neuropathy.
The patient wishes to proceed with adjuvant therapy.  We will have a port placed next week, and we will plan on beginning chemotherapy the first week in August.  I answered all questions the patient had about his cancer.
#2 Type-2 diabetes
At the current time, he is on oral agents only for his type-2 diabetes.  He is on glimepiride.  I did explain that this has the potential to make him hypoglycemic if he is not eating well due to the chemotherapy.  He does check his blood sugars quite frequently, and so I recommend he continue to do this while on the chemotherapy.

Reverend Hunter is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman whose oncologic history is as follows:
1.  2007 - Colonoscopy performed negative, suboptimal preparation.
2.  June 11, 2010 - Due to continued anemia, underwent a colonoscopy which noted an ulcerated mass between the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve measuring 5 x 4-cm.  This was biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.
3.  June 14, 2010 - CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted soft-tissue thickening of the cecum.  Some regional lymphadenopathy identified with the largest node being 1.7 x 1.7-cm.
4.  June 23, 2010 - Dr. Mcdermott performed a right hemicolectomy.  Pathology revealed a 3.8- x 3.6- x 1.0-cm tumor which invaded into the pericolic fat.  Per operative report, there was no evidence of intraabdominal spread or other abnormality.  Pathology of the tissue positive for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma grade 3 (of 4) located in the cecum.   Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat.  Negative surgical margins.  Of 43 regional lymph nodes removed, five were involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma with extranodal extension.  Stage IIIB (T3, N2a, M0).  CEA level at the time of diagnosis was 6.8, and postoperative CEA level on July 21, 2010, was 1.6.
Interval history:  Mr. Hunter is here to discuss further management of his stage III colon cancer.  Overall, he has recovered from his surgery quite well.  He has got minimal pain and discomfort.  He is eating and drinking normally.  Normal urination.  He has no new physical complaints today.
