Final Diagnosis
A.  Skin, perianal region, excision:  Skin tag.

B.  Colon, distal sigmoid, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (2.4 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm) located in the distal sigmoid colon abutting the rectum.  Treatment associated changes are identified.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in a single (1 of 32) regional lymph node.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N1a] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""perianal skin tag"" are two fragments of tan wrinkled skin (1.8 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm and 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm).  All submitted.  Grossed by BREWER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid, rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 18.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 2.4 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm ulcerative mass is present at the junction of the sigmoid and rectum, 3.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 1.5 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BOSWELL.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""distal ring anastomosis site--rectum"" is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm annular fragment of grossly unremarkable bowel mucosa.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by BREWER.


Frozen Sect-Intraop
B.  Colon, distal sigmoid, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (2.4 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm) located in the distal sigmoid colon abutting the rectum.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphovascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Hold over to evaluate lymph nodes on permanent sections.
