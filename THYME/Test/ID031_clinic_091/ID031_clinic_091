Mr. Duran is a pleasant 55 year-old gentleman from FL, West Virginia who underwent a screening colonoscopy in the latter part of December that showed a very large polyp in the distal ascending colon about 4 to 5-cm in size.  Subsequently he underwent complex endoscopy in early February in which the polyp was removed piecemeal.  A small edge of residual polyp was treated with APC.  The final pathology showed an invasive grade 2 (of 4) arising from a tubulovillous adenoma, low-grade dysplasia.  The tumor itself invaded the submucosa and extended to less than 1-mm from the cauterized deep margin.  Angiolymphatic invasion and poorly-differentiated component was not identified.  He presents to Dr. Hamm service for surgical intervention.
His PMH and PSH is outlined below.
