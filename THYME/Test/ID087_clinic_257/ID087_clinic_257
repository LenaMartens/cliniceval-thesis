Mr. Johns Hager is a 67-year-old gentleman who presents today for reevaluation here at the East Texas Memorial Hospital.  Mr. Hager is from LA.  Phone calls were received last week after a workup at-home had been ongoing for approximately a week or two regarding his abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and distress after eating.  Initial symptoms he felt were probably related to diverticular disease, so he was increasing the fiber in his diet which made symptoms worse.  On presentation to his doctors at-home, he was found to have lesions in his liver that appeared to be neoplastic.  Lab data was also obtained and showed minimal anemia.  Workup continued with a colonoscopy which showed a lesion which was partially obstructing at the ileocolonic junction.  This appeared to be a polypoid mass which on biopsy apparently did show malignancy.  He then called and wanted to be seen here and made arrangements to get him in here today which was our earliest opportunity for our review.  Mr. Hager has been prescheduled for some lab work which this morning was done and showed a hemoglobin of 13.1; the remainder of his CBC was normal.  His chemistry study showed his glucose at 128, moderately elevated for a fasting glucose.  He was fasting for approximately 12 hours before this blood sample.  His chest x-ray and electrocardiogram are pending.  He is scheduled to be seen by one of our colon and rectal surgeons this afternoon.
Other symptoms have included increasing bloating, dyspepsia, and difficulties with weight-loss as a result of the alterations of his diet having gone essentially to a clear-liquid diet with the only real solids being noodle soup.  He has lost about 26 pounds he believes since the onset of his symptoms four to six-weeks ago.  He does bring along a CT-scan that is on film.  We will have this reviewed by our radiologist, but we will leave it available for Dr. Hernandez to see this afternoon.
Mr. Hager does have a history of previous colon polyps when we saw him here in 2008.  We discussed the fact that his last colonoscopy was done in 2002.  A number of polyps had been removed at that time.  He was told that rechecking his colon in ten years was appropriate; however, we recommended that he have his colon checked during that visit.  Initially, he was agreeable.  However, when he returned on a Friday two days later, his colonoscopy had not been done and apparently was not done at-home either in the interim.
Other medical problems have included chronic prostatitis, aortic valvular regurgitation, and episodes of atrial fibrillation currently treated with sotalol successfully and followed here in Cardiology.  He does have a history of coronary disease but has had a recent echocardiogram at-home which shows excellent well-preserved ejection fraction.  He has mild hyperlipidemia on treatment, some degenerative arthritis, mild hypertension, and previous squamous cell carcinoma on his left ear.
