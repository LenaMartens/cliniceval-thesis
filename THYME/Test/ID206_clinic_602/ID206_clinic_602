#1 Resected metastatic rectal cancer
I returned a call to Mrs. Brock this afternoon.  She was in a bit of a panic and anxious state over receiving the results of some laboratory studies obtained this week.  Seems as though she had been feeling somewhat week and relayed this information to her local physicians.  CBC was obtained that demonstrated significant enema to just less then 8, these laboratory studies have been sent here for our review.  In addition, a CEA was obtained that demonstrated an increase to a level of approximately 20.  This is a significant increase over previous values.  Mrs. Brock local oncologist is unavailable today and as she is quite anxious and worried about this she had requested to speak to me this afternoon. I consulted Mrs. Brock that while this certainly is concerning for recurrent cancer, it by no means is certain.  I discussed with her that are several other possibilities that could cause an increase CEA that are not cancer.  She is scheduled to see her local oncologist next week.  I discussed with Mrs. Brock that it is probably fairly likely that her local physician recommends imaging with a CAT scan or a PET/CT.  I discussed with her that either of these studies would be reasonable in this situation and some people would favor one over the other.  Whichever one her local oncologist would prefer would be completely fine with us.  Mrs. Brock was wondering whether or not coming back to Briarcliff Manor earlier then her next scheduled appointment in December would be appropriate and if they should make plans at this time.  I told her that I would like to have her meet with her local oncologist first and pursue any investigation they feel are indicated locally.  If after those investigations they would like to visit with us in Briarcliff Manor, I would be happy to see her at an earlier date.
I consulted Mrs. Brock to try and relax and be calm during this period of time.  Again, I reiterated that just because the CEA has increased a bit, does not necessarily mean that her rectal cancer has recurred.  She communicated that she appreciated the call and thanked me for my time today.  All her questions were answered.
