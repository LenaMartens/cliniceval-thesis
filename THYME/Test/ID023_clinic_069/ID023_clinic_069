#1 Adenocarcinoma of the cecum
This disease was resected on July 1, 2010, by Dr. Ballard.  Imaging studies, that did not include a CT-scan of the chest, had not shown any obvious sign of metastasis.  The tumor was staged pT3N1.  While staging at this point is not quite completed, I discussed with Mrs. Romano and her daughter at the bedside the treatment of stage III adenocarcinoma of the colon.  I explained that usually adjuvant chemotherapy is offered to decrease the likelihood of metastatic spread or recurrence.  Adjuvant chemotherapy will not completely omit the chance of recurrence.  Mrs. Romano' case is, however, complicated by her multiple comorbidities, her currently poor performance status caused by recovery from the surgical procedure 1-month ago, and especially the acute medical problem of the rejection of a kidney.  The Renal Team plans, is pursuing further immunosuppression in the form of high-dose steroids and maybe even rituximab.
The main question that did arise during this consultation was whether chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting would be influenced by the immunosuppressive therapy as well as the graft rejection or vice versa.  I explained that there is no data indicating a outcomes in this specific situation.  Several facts should, however be considered:  1.  The purpose of adjuvant therapy is to decrease the chance of recurrence, not completely eliminate the possibility of recurrence.  Therefore, the acute medical problem might be addressed first.  2.  Chemotherapy would likely not interfere with high-dose steroids but might not be well-tolerated in the setting of therapy with rituximab.  3.  Attempts to save the kidney should take priority.  4.   There is no evidence that adjuvant therapy initiated more than 2.5 to 3 months after the initial surgery, can still decrease the chance of recurrence.  Should attempts to halt the rejection of the kidney fail during a time where Mrs. Ahrens would still be eligible for adjuvant therapy, reassessment and examination of her performance status would be necessary before making a final decision.  5.  I explained that in a usual scenario, we would give FOLFOX combination chemotherapy.  However, in patients over the age of 75, this is often poorly tolerated, and it is not certain whether it is as efficacious as in younger patients.  Alternatively, therapy could be started with either Xeloda or 5-FU leucovorin only.
In summary, I feel that at the current time, Mrs. Romano is not a candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy.  She should be reevaluated in the Medical Oncology outpatient practice as scheduled.  Based on her performance status and the outcome of the attempts to rescue her kidney should be known and better defined, and more definite conclusions could be reached by a discussion whether to give chemotherapy or not.
Of note, no imaging of the chest has so far been performed to rule-out metastasis to the lungs.  Since this is a site where colon cancer often metastasizes, imaging of the chest should be performed either with an MRI or a CT-scan.  I would also obtain a baseline CEA at this point.
We will be more than happy to follow-up with Mrs. Romano as scheduled on August 12 of this year and further discuss our approach to therapy.

Mrs. Romano is an 82-year-old woman who was admitted to the inpatient service at Milwaukee Childrens Hospital for acute renal failure, dehydration secondary to rejection of a renal graft.
On June 28, 2010, she presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain.  Medical workup eventually revealed an obstructing mass in the cecum.  There was no evidence of metastatic spread.  On July 1, 2010, Dr. Ballard performed an open right hemicolectomy as well as an end-ileostomy.  The pathology report describes a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 9.2 x 4.6 x 1.2-cm flat ulcerated mass in the cecum.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria (T3).  The surgical resection margins were negative for dysplasia and tumor.  There was lymphatic/vascular invasion present in the form of a pericolonic soft-tissue implant.  Regional lymph nodes (2 out of 13) were positive for tumor.  The omentum that was taken out was negative for tumor.  The staging was therefore pT3N1.  After dismissal from the hospital, Mrs. Romano was transferred to a nursing home.  She states that during her postoperative course, she suffered from quite a bit of diarrhea.
Workup for the renal failure during the current admission revealed acute rejection of the renal transplant graft and attempts at salvaging the kidney are currently pursued.
