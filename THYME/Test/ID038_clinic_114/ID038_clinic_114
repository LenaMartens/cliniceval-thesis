#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma with positive lymph nodes
#2 Resected metastatic liver disease
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Guillory and Dr. Jessie Brackett.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Mckinney, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Mr. Thomas is interested in returning to the Alcorn Home for formal treatment evaluation.  Therefore, I have made follow-up arrangements for the patient to return in approximately four weeks to be evaluated by Dr. Brown.  I will coordinate an appointment with Dr. Gillespie to discuss the feasibility of resection of his pulmonary lesion.  He understands that at some point he will probably be eligible for further chemotherapy, but the ultimate plan will be decided at a later date.  At that time, he will undergo a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, comprehensive lab panel, and a postoperative evaluation with Dr. Powell.  Mr. Thomas and his family verbalized understanding and wish to proceed.

Mr. Thomas is a very pleasant 81-year-old male from Indiana Independence.  He is an established patient of Dr. Ashley Lee Brown's.  I was asked to see him for postoperative education purposes.
1.  May 2010 - presented locally with abdominal discomfort.  Subsequent colonoscopy performed showing a 6.0-cm x 4.0-cm rectal mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  PET/CT-scan showing FDG uptake in a right lower lung nodule, the primary rectal mass, and two liver lesions.
2.  June 2010 - right pulmonary lesion biopsies confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma with a colorectal primary.
3.  June through July 2010 - received concurrent chemotherapy with infusional 5-FU and radiation.  Overall tolerated well.
4.  October 2010 - seen by Dr. Brown of Medical Oncology, Dr. Chris Gillespie of Thoracic Surgery, Dr. Felix of Colorectal Surgery, and Dr. Powell of General Surgery with the joint consensus to proceed with resection of the primary rectal cancer and the liver lesions with subsequent resection of the lung nodule at a later date.
5.  October 29, 2010 - underwent low-anterior resection with temporary diverting loop ileostomy and left hepatectomy by Drs. Felix and Powell.  Surgical pathology from the colorectal resection noting grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 2.0-cm x 1.2-cm x 0.5-cm mass in the rectum invading into the muscularis propria.  The tumor extended to within 1.5-cm of the radial resection margins.  Negative surgical margins, and 6 of 22 regional lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.  Liver wedge resection of II, III, and IV consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma forming a 3.0-cm x 2.8-cm x 2.4-cm mass with negative surgical margins by 0.5-cm.  Wedge resection of liver Segment V consistent with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma forming a 2.4-cm x 2.0-cm x 1.6-cm mass present at the surgical resection margin.  Staged at a T2, N2, M1.
Mr. Thomas is currently in the ICU having been admitted after an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension requiring transfusion.  He is overall stable and doing well.
