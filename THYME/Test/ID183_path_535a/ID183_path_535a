Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an exophytic mass (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm) located 2.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Tumor invades the submucosa. Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.
B.  Rectosigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
