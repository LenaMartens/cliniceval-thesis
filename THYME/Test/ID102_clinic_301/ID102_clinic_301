LABORATORY
Reviewed outside colonoscopy pathology.  See chest x-ray and lab data.
#1 Colon cancer at the rectosigmoid junction
Mr. Burns presents for surgical management of colon cancer described at 16 cm from the anal verge.  We discussed location issues with regard to colorectal cancer, and I have requested colorectal surgery consultation for this afternoon with consideration of flexible sigmoidoscopy and tattooing to confirm the location.  Patient is interested in laparoscopic surgery, and his only prior abdominal surgery was appendectomy in the 1940s.  His CT and chest x-ray will be sent to Radiology for interpretation.  Lab work, ECG, and Colorectal Surgery consultations are pending.
We discussed the role for adjunctive treatment if this is colon cancer as well as neoadjuvant treatment if this is felt more consistent with a rectal cancer on flexible sigmoidoscopy.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, patient is okay for anesthesia.  Lakeview Family Practice Radiology reviewed his outside chest x-ray.  Please see HPI for other PAME details.
Discussed with Paul Walling, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mr. Burns is a delightful 75-year-old gentleman who presents for further treatment of rectosigmoid cancer.  He has had hematochezia intermittently for years and has had treatment for hemorrhoids.  However, lately he has noticed more of a change in his bowel habits and an increase in bloating.  He underwent colonoscopy December 18, 2009, which demonstrated a mass in the rectosigmoid junction described as 16 cm from the anus.  Biopsies taken from the mass were positive for invasive adenocarcinoma.  Lakeview Family Practice Pathology has received slides and interpretation is pending.  Internal and external hemorrhoids were likewise noted.  No synchronous lesions were observed.  Staging CT abdomen and pelvis and chest x-ray were negative for metastatic disease.  No worrisome incidental findings were noted.  Laboratory studies indicate a normal hemoglobin at 14.4.  His PSA is normal at 2.8, CEA is normal at 1.5 ng/mL in this nonsmoking gentleman.  Mr. Burns presents for surgical treatment.
Mr. Burns is otherwise healthy.  Chronic comorbidities include hypertension for which he uses lisinopril.  He has no other cardiopulmonary history.  There is no history of bleeding disorders, anesthesia reactions, medications, allergies, sleep apnea, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, or glaucoma.
