#1 Newly-diagnosed, grade 3 out of 4, infiltrating, synchronous adenocarcinoma of the colon
At this point the patient has had appropriate staging evaluation by her outside providers.  We do have a copy of both the CT abdomen and pelvis and PET scan done at an outside institution.  We will have our radiologists interpret both of those films and better clarify extent of tumor involvement.  She has previously had CBC, electrolytes, LFTs done at an outside institution, and thus, we will not repeat those.  If you would like to see those exact values, they are in the HPI section of this note.  She did have a CEA that was normal at 1.2 July 29, 2010.  At this point we will refer her to Colorectal Surgery for further evaluation.  She will need surgical intervention and then possible chemotherapy and radiation.  We will also consider referral to Medical Oncology pending surgical results.
From a premedical anesthesia evaluation, the patient will undergo an EKG today and will get a chest x-ray.  Her labs have already been mentioned above in the HPI section.  She has had anesthesia with her previous hysterectomy in 1991 with no difficulties.  She has no family history of prolonged bleeding or abnormal bleeding.  She also has no personal history of any bleeding disorders.  She can climb 2 flights of stairs with no difficulty.  I see no reason why she should not be able to proceed directly to surgery pending the chest x-ray and EKG results.
#2 Possible Lynch syndrome
Due to the fact that she has a family history of colon cancer in her father and a sister with uterine cancer, I think it is reasonable to consider this diagnosis.  We will do a urine cytology to rule-out any bladder neoplasms.  In addition, we will consider referral to Medical Genetics for further evaluation.  We will have her outside block sent to Saint Lukes Living County Memorial Hospital and reviewed for specific Lynch syndrome abnormalities.  Depending on results, her children may need their own evaluation.

#1 Newly-diagnosed Synchronous Infiltrating Colon Adenocarcinoma, grade 3 of 4
The patient originally developed abdominal pain which was described as a colicky, crampy pressure that was 4 out of 10, with no radiation in the beginning of June 2010.  Roughly a month later on July 9, 2010, she presented to her primary-care doctor.  At that time she reported intermittent episodes of bright-red blood in her stool, which she originally thought was secondary to hemorrhoids.  She does have a family history of colon cancer in her father who was diagnosed at age 51 and died at age 56.  The patient at that point had never undergone a colonoscopy and thus was scheduled for a colonoscopy on July 26, 2010.  That colonoscopy revealed a 4-cm sessile nonobstructive lesion at 15-cm in the rectosigmoid junction.  In addition, there was a second lesion seen in the cecum which was described as an ulcerated, friable mass that was also nonobstructing.  The exact size of this mass was not described, but the report describes it as several centimeters in size.
The biopsies of both lesions revealed infiltrating adenocarcinoma, grade 3 of 4, which was verified by our Saint Lukes Living County Memorial Hospital pathologists.  Thus, the patient at that time was diagnosed with synchronous rectosigmoid and cecal adenocarcinoma.  She underwent an abdominal and pelvic CT-scan on July 30, 2010.  This CT-scan revealed small axillary, mediastinal, and hilar adenopathy.  It also revealed two tiny hypodensities in the liver that were too small to characterize per the radiology report.  Of note, there was increased soft-tissue density near the level of the ileocecal valve which was indeterminate with associated narrowing of the lumen which was suspicious for colon cancer.  The appendix was normal-appearing.  There was no definite adenopathy within the abdomen or pelvis.  There were no definite lung nodules or masses visualized.  Overall, it was a relatively benign test.  The outside images are uploaded in our system and are being interpreted by Saint Lukes Living County Memorial Hospital radiologists as we speak.
The patient also had a PET scan done on August 3, 2010.  This PET scan revealed an increased area of glucose uptake at the ileocecal valve.  There was also an area of intense abnormal glucose uptake in the rectosigmoid region but no other abnormal uptake was seen in any lymph nodes or any other abdominal or pelvic structures.
The patient has had some blood work done at the outside institution.  She had a CEA done on July 29, 2010, which revealed a value of 1.2 with a reference range of less than 5 ng/mL.  She had an albumin also drawn on the same-day which was 4.0, alk-phos of 78, a total bilirubin of 0.3, AST of 32, a total protein of 8.1, ALT of 21.  She also had a CBC which revealed a white count of 6.6, a hemoglobin of 13.1, hematocrit of 40.1, and a platelet count of 413.  She also had electrolytes done revealing a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.7, and chloride of 103, glucose of 99, creatinine of 1, calcium of 10.1, and a BUN of 10.
Currently, the patient states that she is not having any symptoms.  She has no abdominal pain.  The last time she noticed blood in her stool was a week ago.  She is not having any constipation or diarrhea.  Patient states that she is eating a high-fiber diet and a diet that is also low in red meat.
