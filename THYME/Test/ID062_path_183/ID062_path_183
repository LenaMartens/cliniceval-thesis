Final Diagnosis
A.  Omentum, excisional biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin.
B.  Peritoneum, right diaphragm, biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin.

C.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an annular mass (4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm) located in the ascending colon, 6.5 cm from the distal margin. The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat and involves the serosal surface.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  The tumor extends to within 1.0 cm of the radial margin.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (6 of 21) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2M1] (7th edition, 2009).
This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""omental mass"" is a 5.2 x 4.8 x 1.6 cm portion of omentum.  There is a diffusely firm area present.  Lymph nodes are not identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by OWENS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""right diaphragmatic peritoneal biopsy"" is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm aggregate of pink yellow fibroadipose tissue.  All submitted.   Grossed by OWENS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 9.5 cm of terminal ileum, 16.5 cm of colon, and a 4.5 x 0.8 cm appendix.  A 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm annular mass is present within the ascending colon, 5.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Deepest extent of the tumor is 2.0 cm, and tumor perforation is present.  The mass is 6.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 1.0 cm from the radial margin.  There is a 0.8 x 0.6 cm erythematous area in the cecum.  No masses are present in the cecum.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by OWENS.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Bobby Hiers, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed by ARUP Bevilacqua on paraffin-embedded ascending colon tumor tissue (block C1).  When completed, results will be available in ZXBK ZyoeHmub (Documents/Notes and Reports/Sent out Lab Test Report).
