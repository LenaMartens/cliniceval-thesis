Final Diagnosis
A.  Endometrium, curettage:  Complex hyperplasia with atypia with foci bordering on well differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Seen in consultation with Dr. Bernie Berg.

B-C.  Rectum, No. 1 and 2, biopsies:   Poorly differentiated invasive signet ring cell  adenocarcinoma.  Lymphatic invasion is identified.  Immunohistochemical stains (OSCAR, CK7, CK20, S100, melan A, CD45, CD20) were performed on the paraffin embedded rectal tissue.  The neoplastic cells are strongly positive for OSCAR and CK20 and negative for CK7, S100, melan A, CD45 and CD20 supporting the above diagnosis.  Seen in consultation with Dr. Billy J. Yang.
