Mr. Longoria is a pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who three years ago underwent a colonoscopy, and two small polyps were noted.  He had a followup colonoscopy, and a 2-cm lesion was noted 18 cm from the anal verge.  This was described as being on a broad stalk and was resected endoscopically and revealed a moderately-to-poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A CT-scan was unremarkable.  He comes now for surgical management of this colon cancer.
