#1 Stage III colon cancer
I had a long discussion with the patient and the son in the room regarding the situation.  The patient would be expected to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  The benefit from chemotherapy is likely to amount to an approximately 50% reduction in the chance of death in five years with the risk of recurrence without chemotherapy in the 30% to 40% range and a risk of recurrence after chemotherapy approximately 10% to 20%.
The patient is to recover from the surgery first, which could take four to six-weeks.  He is pretty confident that he would be wanting treatment back home.
I discussed with him that we will have him come back and see Dr. Stubbs for one more visit in a few weeks while he is recovering.
The patient appreciated the consultation.  He will let us know if he decides to go straight home after he heals from the surgery, at which point we can send our records to his home oncologist with our recommendations for six-months of FOLFOX chemotherapy.
He is currently being evaluated by Cardiology for shortness-of-breath he experienced last night.

A 60-year-old gentleman from the Inglewood presented with anemia requiring 3 units of blood.  A colonoscopy in April 2010 revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 120 cm from the anal verge.  A CT-scan showed a right lobe density and a small right pleural effusion, and an MRI showed multiple suspicious small nodules.  On further review, these nodules were hypervascular in nature and likely benign.  Baseline CEA was 7.7.
A PET scan showed disease in the proximal descending colon right below the splenic flexure, and there was no uptake in the liver.
On June 21, the patient underwent a wedge resection of a liver lesion, finding a cavernous hemangioma 1-cm in size, and a left colon resection revealed a 7-cm grade 2 annular mass in the transverse colon invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat (T3) with negative margins.  One out of 27 original lymph nodes were positive for metastasis involving less than 0.01 cm (N1).  Total stage T3, N1, M0, stage IIIB.
Patient had met prior to the operation with Dr. Stubbs.  We were called by the Surgical Team to discuss with the patient adjuvant options.
