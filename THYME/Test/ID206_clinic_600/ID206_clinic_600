#1 Recurrent metastatic rectal cancer
Mrs. Brock has certainly done well over the last two years after her diagnosis of metastatic rectal cancer.  She tolerated her initial regimen of FOLFOX plus Avastin quite well and subsequently has not tolerated FOLFIRI plus Avastin.  She specifically inquires the role of tumor-directed therapy including CyberKnife radiation or surgical excision of the site such that she would not need chemotherapy for some period of time.  We discussed general roles of these interventions in her.  We additionally discussed the curative potential of any interaction in her specific situation.  I discussed with her that it is my impression that the chance of curing this is quite small but still a significant chance.  I discussed with her, however, that since I do believe it unlikely that we should really try to maintain her quality of life as much as possible.  I would like to have her evaluated by one of our colorectal surgeons, which we will try to arrange for today.  Subsequently, after discussion with the surgeon, we may additionally discuss with our radiation oncology colleagues.
Were she to undergo surgical excision such that she was rendered no evidence of disease, I would likely recommend no administration of chemotherapy in that setting versus a maintenance chemotherapy like 5-FU/ leucovorin/Avastin, or capecitabine with Avastin.  However, I would favor observation alone if we were to render her no evidence of disease due to the limited likelihood of preventing disease from coming back.
On the other hand, were she not to undergo surgical excision, radiation, or other tumor-directed treatment, I would favor reinstituting FOLFOX with Avastin for a short number of cycles, perhaps four, and then as disease reevaluation.  If she has stable to improved disease, which I suspect that she may, I would then consider ongoing maintenance chemotherapy with capecitabine/Avastin versus 5-FU/leucovorin/Avastin.  I discussed the rationale for all of this with her in terms of maintaining disease control and maintaining her exceptional quality of life that she has at this point.
She mentioned to me with her husband present that they had cancelled a trip home to Ether to visit friends and relatives due to the increased CEA.  I specifically encouraged her to continue to live her life to the best extent possible and to not let the cancer live her life for her.  Certainly, allowances in rescheduling could be possible if she continues to be asymptomatic and we continue to have good control of her disease such that flexibility would be warranted to allow her to make such trips to maintain such an exceptional quality of life.
Again, we will see if we can get one of our colorectal surgeons to see her this morning and go from there.

Mrs. Brock is a very pleasant 68-year-old Xtgsevduaa female with the following pertinent oncologic history:
1. July 2007, on a screening endoscopy, she was found to have a rectal polyp.  This was biopsied and found to have a small focus of invasive adenocarcinoma.  She subsequently underwent a transanal excision at which time pathology demonstrated clean margins and a maximum dimension of 0.3 cm.  This was felt to represent a stage I rectal cancer with T2, N0, M0.
2. May 2008, after being followed with observation alone, she ultimately develops a rise in her CEA.  Cross-sectional imaging demonstrated hydronephrosis and a right pelvic mass.  She subsequently underwent debulking with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  This again demonstrated pathology consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  At this time, she was found to be K-ras mutant.
3. August 2008 through February 2009, receives 12 cycles of FOLFOX plus Avastin.  She has toxicities including mild peripheral neuropathy that develops within 24 to 48 hours after the administration of oxaliplatin and resolves three-to-four days later.  At no time does she develop neuropathy that has not resolved before the next administration of the oxaliplatin.  She is left with no residual neuropathy.  In addition, she developed hypertension to the 180 to 190 mmHg systolic level.  She was treated with Diovan and subsequently hydrochlorothiazide to manage this.  She returns to normotensive while on this therapy.
4. November 2009, CEA begins to increase.  There is abnormal uptake on a PET scan near the rectosigmoid junction.  She is then initiated on XELIRI/Avastin in February 2010.  She subsequently completed six cycles through the beginning of April 2010.  During the administration of XELIRI and Avastin, she had persistent nausea throughout most of her chemotherapy cycle.  She additionally had fairly marked constipation as well as rectal bleeding.  She additionally developed hypertension while on this regimen as well.  In April, after four cycles, she declined further chemotherapy at that point.  Repeat imaging and laboratory parameters in May of 2010 demonstrated a normal CEA and a CT that demonstrated no evidence of disease.
5. May 2010 through August 2010, managed with observation alone off of all chemotherapeutic administration.  Early April 2010, there is a recurrence at the same site that was noted on the scan in late 2009.  This is noted on PET/CT.
Mrs. Brock has now sought consultation in Briarcliff Manor for her likely recurrent metastatic rectal carcinoma.  She is feeling quite well; however, she is a bit anxious with the recurrence after being off therapy for several months' time.  She is anxious when thinking about ongoing chemotherapeutic administration.  She is basically asymptomatic otherwise.  She has no abdominal discomfort.  Her weight is stable, and she denies any hematochezia or melena.  She leads an active life and is asymptomatic.
