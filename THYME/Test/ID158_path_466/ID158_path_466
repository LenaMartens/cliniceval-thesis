Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (3.4 x 2.8 x 1.2 cm) located 2.6 cm from the rectal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (61) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
