Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Fibrosis and inflammation involving an area, 1.8 cm, in greatest dimension, in the proximal ascending colon.  No residual tumor is identified.  The surgical margins are negative.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  A tubular adenoma (0.5 cm, in greatest dimension) is also present.  One regional lymph node contains necrotic debris (consistent with treated tumor) and multiple (13) other lymph nodes are benign.  

B.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Gallbladder without diagnostic abnormality.

C.  Liver, portion of segment IVB, wedge resection:  Globally necrotic tumor associated with surrounding fibrosis and inflammation forming an encapsulated mass, 2.7 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.9 cm).

D.  Liver, portion of segment VI, wedge resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma forming a mass (3.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm).  Extensive tumor necrosis consistent with treatment effect is present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.4 cm).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 24.5 cm of terminal ileum, 20.3 cm of cecum and ascending colon, 9.4 x 0.6 cm appendix, and an 18.2 x 15.3 x 3.7 cm portion of attached omentum.  A 1.8 cm indurated area is present within the proximal ascending colon located 3.2 cm from the ileocecal valve and 16.0 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  There is also a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm polyp in the ascending colon located 3.5 cm distal to the indurated area.  Multiple (21) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by TASKER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 6.2 x 3.2 x 0.9 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  No stones are present within the lumen.  Cholesterolosis is identified.  No masses are identified.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by TASKER.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""portion liver segment IVB"" is a 43.31 gram, 5.5 x 4.8 x 3.3 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 2.7 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm soft, yellow, necrotic capsular mass is present 0.9 cm from the closest surgical resection margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by TASKER.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""portion liver segment 6"" is an 80.0 gram, 8.0 x 5.2 x 5.2 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 3.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm necrotic mass is present 0.4 cm from the closest  surgical resection margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HOSEY.




Addendum Diagnosis
The AJCC stain is ypT0 N1M1.
