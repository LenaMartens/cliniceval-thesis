#1 T2, N1c (TD), AJCC stage IIIA, Dukes stage C colorectal cancer, status-post extended low-anterior resection with J-pouch descending colorectostomy
#2 Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, grade 2, stage T1a, status-post right partial nephrectomy
PLAN
At this time for his rectal carcinoma, he has already received neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy with Xeloda.  The plan would be now to initiate FOLFOX 6 regimen which was discussed at length with him.  The plan would be to give a total of eight cycles with each cycle being 14 days.  He already has a port  in place.  I discussed at length the side-effects of therapy including but not limited to life-threatening infections, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, myelosuppression, cardiac side-effects, dehydration, mucositis, acute and peripheral neuropathy related to FOLFOX regimen.  He understands that since none of these drugs have been tried before, it is possible he might be allergic to one of them.  He is willing to proceed.  We will administer as many cycles as possible before his surgical closure of ileostomy which is scheduled in January.  A month prior to the scheduled procedure, his cycles would have to be stopped and resumed a month after the procedure.  This approach has been recommended by Dr. Braaten, his primary colorectal surgeon.  I have discussed the case extensively with Dr. Kale who agrees with aforementioned approach at this time.

Mr. Uselton Tyler is a very pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who has the following oncologic history:
1.  January 2010, he started to notice intermittent rectal bleeding accompanied by mild bloating.  He denied any abdominal pain or pain during defecation.  He initially attributed this to stress but ultimately underwent a colonoscopy on May 28, 2010, at Bothwell and Women's Hospital with a diagnosis of invasive grade 2 adenocarcinoma of the rectum.
2.  June 9, 2010, he had a colonoscopy with an endorectal ultrasound.  This confirmed a rectal mass covering one-half of the circumference extending from 7 to 11-cm above the anal verge.  It was located on the anterior abdominal wall.  By ultrasound criteria, it was felt to be T2 tumor.  At some small areas muscularis propria appeared breached but not clearly infiltrated.  In addition, two peritumoral lymph nodes were identified (0.4 x 0.3 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 cm).  It was, however, not possible to obtain FNA as both nodes apparently would have required the needle to pass through the tumor tissue.  Thus, it was elected to not sample the nodes.  Per summary of the gastroenterologist (Dr. Goodwin) based on ultrasonographic findings, his tumor was T2, N1.  He underwent further staging with chest x-ray, which was negative, and CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  This apparently demonstrated a 16- x 15-mm round mass arising from the medial aspect of lower pole of the right kidney which was suspicious for malignancy.  A subsequent retroperitoneal ultrasound demonstrated a 1.9- x 1.8- x 2-cm solid mass in the medial lower pole of the right kidney corresponding to the presumed solid mass described on the CT-scan suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.  In addition, tiny benign 6-mm cysts were noted both on ultrasound and on CT-scan in the left kidney.  There was no evidence of hydronephrosis. There was no regional lymphadenopathy noted on CT-scan.
3.  June 16, 2010, started on neoadjuvant  RT with concurrent chemotherapy.
He has completed his radiation therapy 5040 cGy on July 26.  He was receiving concurrent capecitabine therapy which he tolerated very well.
4.  He underwent exploratory laparotomy, extended low-anterior resection with J-pouch descending colorectostomy and diverting ileostomy, right partial nephrectomy for mid rectal cancer and renal mass.  Pathology revealed a tumor implant in the pericolonic fat with 15 negative nodes.  By AJCC staging, it was a T2, N1c with TD (tumor deposit).  The kidney mass was suggestive of a grade 2 chromophobe renal cell carcinoma forming a mass of 2.3 x 1.9 x 1.6-cm.  The surgical margins were negative for tumor.  It was a pT1a by AJCC seventh edition.  His postoperative course was complicated with a small-bowel obstruction when his stoma stopped having output, and he developed abdominal distension and pain.  He was treated conservatively and underwent NG tube decompression.  This complication developed a few days  after surgery.  He was briefly admitted for this complication and discharged again on September 21.  Since then, he states his stoma has been functioning well, and he denies any new symptoms.  Specifically, he denies any fever, chills, loss of appetite, abdominal pain.  States his ileostomy has been functioning well.  He denies any headache, chest pain, shortness-of-breath.  He denies any arthralgias.  He denies noticing any blood in his stools.
