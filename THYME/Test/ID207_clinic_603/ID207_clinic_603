#1 Colon cancer 18 cm from an anal verge
See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Carson, who also met with Mr. Longoria and his family.  Please see his supervisory note.  We will attempt to get a colorectal surgeon sooner than next week.  If Mr. Longoria feels that he wishes surgery here, we would need blood work, chest x-ray, ECG.  From my standpoint with those tests pending, he would be okay anesthesia with no cardiopulmonary issues.

#1 Colon cancer at 18 cm from the anal verge
Mr. Longoria is a 50-year-old male who three years ago had a Schatzki's ring dilated and was found to have two precancerous, presumed tubular adenomas in his colon.  He returned most recently in July with dysphagia symptoms and again had Schatzki's ring dilated and had another colonoscopy.  He was found to have a 2-cm lesion 18 cm from the anal verge.   Pathology read here showing invasive grade 3 of 4 moderate to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  Immunohistochemical stains were performed at the referring institution and were normal.  The original colonoscopy on 26 July 2010, colonoscopist tattooed this are.  His CT abdomen and pelvis 29 July 2010 did not show any metastatic disease, abdomen or pelvis.  He then had on 3 August 2010 he had rectal ultrasound at-home which demonstrated a T1 lesion with no perirectal lymphadenopathy noted.   A 2- to 3-mm polyp near the tattooed area was removed, and outside pathology showed that to be a tubular adenoma.  He was offered laparoscopic segmental resection by colorectal surgeon closer to home and comes to Marion Family Practice Medical Center-Bartlett for a second opinion.
