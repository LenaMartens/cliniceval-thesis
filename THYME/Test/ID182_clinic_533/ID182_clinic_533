#1 Rectal cancer
#2 von Willebrand's disease
Mrs. Vargas is a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with rectal cancer after about one-year history of BRBPR and rectal discomfort.  At the time of diagnosis, she had a colonoscopy done and CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis that did not reveal any evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease.  Unfortunately, we do not have information about the extent of her tumor at the time of diagnosis.  The patient states that one of the surgeons that she was seeing noted on exam that it has shrunk significantly with chemoradiation.  Following chemoradiation, the patient underwent surgical resection and on pathology, she was noted to have 1.4 x 0.4 x  0.4 tumor after lower anterior resection and with abdominal perineal resection, there was residual mass forming a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm in the lower rectum.  Based on pathology, she was staged as pT2.  We can assume that given the shrinkage of the tumor and the invasion into muscularis propria currently, there was most likely a more significant extension or maybe node involvement prior to initiation of chemoradiation therapy.  Based on that uncertainty as well as the size of the tumor now, we would recommend treatment with adjuvant modified FOLFOX chemotherapy given for eight cycles to decrease her chance of local and distant recurrence.  We would recommend omitting the 5-FU bolus from the regimen. We discussed with the patient major side-effects of this treatment including nausea, rashes, hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, neuropathy with oxaliplatin, low blood counts, and others.  She will also need lab test and imaging studies at regular interval following treatment. The patient will follow-up for her chemotherapy closer to home with Dr Denson .
Regarding her von Willebrand's disease she did not have any bleeding post-op while on Humate- P treatment. She was followed by Hematology during her hospitalization.

Mrs. Vargas is a 62-year-old woman with the following oncologic history:
1.  In April of 2010, the patient presented with one-year history of intermittent BRBPR and some rectal discomfort.  April 20, 2010, she underwent colonoscopy that showed abnormality with ulcerated mass in the rectum.  Biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
2.  CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis of April 30, 2010, was negative for any evidence of metastatic disease.  Per patient report, she did not have a rectal EUS.  She was seen by Oncology and Radiation Oncology and initiated on chemoradiation treatment.
3.  May 24, 2010, through July 1, 2010, she was treated with 5040 cGy to the rectal lesion concurrently with 5-FU infusion.  She did have a break at the beginning of her treatment as on May 25, 2010, she was involved in a motor-vehicle accident after passing out behind the wheel of her car; this resulted in a two-day delay.  Per the patient there was significant shrinkage in the lesion on rectal exams during treatment.
4.  After completing chemoradiation, patient was referred to Saint Clair General Hospital.  She was seen in GI Clinic and by Surgery.  She was to undergo hand-assisted coloanal with diverting ileostomy versus abdominal perineal resection depending on the extent of the lesion concurrently with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilaterally salpingo-oophorectomy due to endometrial abnormality noted on the pelvic ultrasound.  Due to family history of type I von Willebrand disease she was seen in Quitman Hospital and maintained on infusion perioperatively.
5.  August 2, 2010, patient underwent APR with complete hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  Pathology showed : rectum, low-anterior resection:  Moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm ulcerated mass in the rectum.  Tumor invaded the submucosa.  The
distal mucosal resection margin was involved by tumor (see part C for completion abdominal perineal resection). The tumor extended to within 2.2-cm of the radial resection margin.  Multiple (18) regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor.
Part C contained rectum and anus after completion of abdominal perineal resection. There was residual moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm ulcerated mass in the lower rectum.  Tumor invaded into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion was absent.  The tumor extended to within 1.3-cm of the radial resection margin.  The anal skin margin is negative (free by 4.2 cm).  Regional lymph nodes were not identified [AJCC pT2] (7th edition, 2010).
Uterine pathology showed simple hyperplasia with marked atypia. There were multiple leiomyomata in the myometrium.
Mrs. Vargas is here today with her husband and sister to discuss need for systemic treatment after her surgery.  She reports recovering slowly from the surgery.  She still has significant fatigue as well as soreness at the site of her surgical procedure.  She is getting use to colostomy and seems to be dealing with it better now.  She reports overall a 20-pound weight-loss since her diagnosis was made in April, but she relates it more to the chemotherapy and radiation, and she did not have any symptoms prior to the diagnosis.  She specifically denies any fevers or chills, night sweats, or systemic symptoms prior to the diagnosis.  Right now, she is tolerating oral intake without any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain other than at the surgical site.
The patient is being followed a local oncologist closer to home, and this is where she would like to pursue her chemotherapy.
