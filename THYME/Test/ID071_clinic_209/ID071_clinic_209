Mrs. Sandoval has had a history of ovarian carcinoma and has had several procedures for this over the past ten years, the last being in 2006 plus she has had two episodes of radiation therapy.  On colonoscopy she has what appears to be fairly definitive damage to the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon.  Also on colonoscopy was noted a large ulcerated cecal mass which appears to be a primary cecal carcinoma, perhaps radiation related.  This is palpable on rectal exam and is located deep in the pelvis.  I discussed exploratory laparotomy with resection of this tumor, and we will ask GYN Surgery to help us if this proves to be of ovarian origin or there are other indications.  I discussed the various options which will be determined at surgery based primarily on where we can find unirradiated small and large bowel.  Hopefully we will be able to do a standard right colectomy with ileal transverse colostomy, but even this may have functional repercussions as she has damage in the distal colon and we discussed this.  The worst-case scenario would be a resection and permanent Brooke ileostomy, and I also discussed the use of temporary ileostomy.  The risks were reviewed.
We will also ask that ureteral stents be placed.  We will plan to proceed on Wednesday.
