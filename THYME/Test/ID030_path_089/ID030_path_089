Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm ulcerated lesion (status post polypectomy) in the transverse colon.  Tumor invades the submucosa.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4) of 56 regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  A tubulovillous adenoma with low grade dysplasia (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.1 cm) is located 4 cm distal to the tumor.   With available surgical material [AJCC pT1N2] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 5.5 cm of terminal ileum, 82.0 cm of colon.  A 1.0 x 1.0 cm mucosal scar with tattoo is present within the proximal transverse colon, 17.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The scar is 22.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  There is a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm puckered polyp area in the transverse colon 42.0 cm from the distal margin and 4.0 cm from the radial margin.  Additionally, there is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.1 cm sessile polyp 4.0 cm distal to the aforementioned polyp.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HOGAN.
