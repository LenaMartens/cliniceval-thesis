Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4), forming a 4.1 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon, invasive into pericolonic soft tissue.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia or tumor.  Multiple (38) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).

B.  Rectum, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa identified (gross examination only).

C.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa identified (gross examination only).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a 19.4 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with a 4.1 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm polypoid annular mass located 7.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin and 0.3 cm from the radial margin.  Deepest tumor invasion is 0.3 cm, and tumor perforation is absent .  A polyp is also present, 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm located 1.7 cm from the closest margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by WOOD.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal rectal ring"" is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm ring of colonic mucosa without gross abnormality.  Gross only.  Grossed by WOOD.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal ring"" is a 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm ring of colonic mucosa without gross abnormality.  Gross only.  Grossed by WOOD.



Addendum Diagnosis
Due to the patient's young age, reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC will be performed; when completed, results will be available in LXAM QpodKpaw (molecular genetics report).
