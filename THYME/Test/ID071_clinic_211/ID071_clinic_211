Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Stacey Delgado.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Edwards, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
PATIENT EDUCATION:
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mrs. Sandoval is a pleasant 59-year-old woman originally from Florida, Pennsylvania, who is presently residing in Soudersburg.  I am seeing her today at the request of Dr. Macek Surgical Service to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a node-positive cecal adenocarcinoma.  Of note, she has had a past history of ovarian cancer.  She is a well-established patient of Dr. Williams.  Her history is as follows:
1.  February 2001: Imaging performed elsewhere noted multiple cysts within the liver, a complex cyst in the left pelvis questioning ovarian source.  CA-125 noted to be elevated at 220.
2.  February 21, 2001: Underwent exploratory laparoscopic procedure with a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with sampling of the pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes.  This was performed elsewhere.  Pathology of this tissue was positive for high-grade infiltrating ovarian carcinoma with mixed endometrioid and serous-type involvement of the left ovary and tube.  Tumor appeared to be adhering the pelvis in the pelvic side wall as documented by biopsy.  Pelvic washings and omentum were negative for disease.
3.  March 5, 2001, through June 18, 2001: Treated with six cycles of Taxol and carboplatin at her local facility per the recommendations of Midlands Center oncologist.  CA-125 had declined to 3.
4.  July 31, 2001: A second-look exploratory laparoscopic procedure performed at Midlands Center noting residual metastatic grade 4 (of 4) tumor consistent with ovarian primary in the vaginal apex region.
5.  August 28, 2001, through October 10, 2001: Patient treated with radiation therapy at Midlands Center.  Received a total of 2550 cGy with a pelvic boost of 2500 cGy.
6.  August 2004: Colonoscopy performed and negative.
7.  August 2005: Imaging and physical exam noting a right inguinal lymph node that was enlarged.  It was subsequently biopsied and found to be positive for metastatic high-grade carcinoma, ovarian primary.
8.  August 19, 2005: Had a right groin lymph node dissection performed at Midlands Center.  Pathology positive for 1.7-cm metastatic grade 3 adenocarcinoma consistent with ovarian primary.  Subsequent PET scan was negative except for the surgical site.
9.  November 11, 2005, through October 14, 2005: Treated with radiation therapy at Midlands Center.  Received a total of 4500 cGy.
10.  July 2009: CT performed elsewhere noting an enlarged cervical lymph node questioning lymphoma.
11.  July 20, 2009: Presented to Midlands Center and underwent biopsy.  Pathology noting follicular and pericortical hyperplasia.
12.  April 15, 2010: CT-scan performed noting cecal fullness.  Patient was also noted to be anemic at this time.
13.  October 16, 2010: Colonoscopy performed noting a large ulcerated cecal mass, biopsy positive for colon adenocarcinoma.  Colonoscopy also noted radiation colopathy of the sigmoid and rectum.
14.  April 21, 2010: Dr. Delgado performed a standard right hemicolectomy with a primary repair of the ureteral lacerations with ureteral stent placement.  Per operative report, the tumor itself was adherent to the bladder and to the right pelvic side wall, apparently in the same area her previous metastatic nodule had been treated.  Pathology of the extended right hemicolectomy tissue, positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, most consistent with colonic origin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolonic soft-tissue and extends to involve the muscularis of the adjacent loop of terminal ileum as well as the perivesical soft-tissue of an attached portion of the bladder wall.  Resected margins negative.  Of 55 regional lymph nodes removed, three were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with colonic origin (pT4, N1).
Today Mrs. Sandoval is two days postoperative.  She is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  Her family is present during this consultation.

1.  Ovarian cancer, this was diagnosed as stage IIC in February 2001, had surgery elsewhere, followed by six cycles of Taxol/carboplatin chemotherapy.  She then had positive second-look surgery with microscopic disease in the apex of the vagina.  She had adjuvant radiation therapy per Dr. Pitt ending October 2001.  Recurrent cancer right groin and a lymph node, this was excised, and she had radiation therapy to this region per by Dr. Pitt in 2005.
2.  Lymphedema both lower-extremity and lower abdominal wall.
3.  Second-hand smoke since her father used to smoke and died of emphysema.
4.  Osteoporosis, on treatment.
5.  Ventral hernia.
6.  Right kidney stones, status-post lithotripsy fall 2006.
7.  Insomnia.
8.  April 21, 2010: underwent a right hemicolectomy for node-positive cecal adenocarcinoma.
