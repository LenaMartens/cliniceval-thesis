Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, transverse, resection:  Poorly differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (2.8 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm) located in the transverse colon, 4.4 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the subserosal fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 14) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion transverse colon"" is a transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 14.2 cm of colon.  A 2.8 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm ulcerative mass is present within the transverse colon, 4.4 cm from the closest mucosal margin, puckering the serosal surface.  The deepest extent of the tumor is 0.8 cm, and tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (14) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by FOLEY.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Cory Jacobsen, HNPCC screen will be performed on transverse colon adenocarcinoma tissue sections (block A1); when completed, results will be available in SJUG WpvjBuqc.


Internal Comments
5/27/10--11 recuts to MG for HNPCC at request of Dr. Cory Jacobsen.
