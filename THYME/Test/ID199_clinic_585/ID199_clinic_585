#1 Intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the rectum
Ms. Hogan does have evidence of a mass lesion at approximately 15-cm from the anal verge which is near the boundary of where we would consider it rectal versus sigmoid in location.  As of this time, we have no evidence of invasive adenocarcinoma, although there is certainly evidence of intramucosal adenocarcinoma.  Given the size of the mass, we do have concern that it may well be invasive.  However, without this knowledge and complete staging, it is very difficult to make recommendations regarding the best plan of care at this time.  I am reassured that there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease on the CT-scan or chest x-ray performed today.
To obtain more complete staging, I have discussed with Dr. Depriest the potentiality of having her undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy, and depending on what is seen on this study, perhaps a transrectal ultrasound to complete staging.  He is in agreement with this plan and also raises the possibility of potential endoscopic removal of this lesion, at which time further pathology could be performed and staging completed.  Dr. Depriest will see Ms. Hogan later this afternoon and make his recommendations at that time.  We will also obtain a CT-scan of the chest to ensure no distant metastatic disease in that location.
This was discussed at length with Ms. Hogan who asked multiple informed questions that were answered this afternoon.
I have discussed this patient at length with Dr. Herring who has seen and examined the patient.  Please see her supervisory note for further details.

Ms. Hogan is a very pleasant 49-year-old female who was in her usual state of health until July of this year when she underwent screening colonoscopy.  She states that prior to this, she had no GI symptoms, frankly denying anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight-loss, diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool, or change in stool caliber.  During this procedure on July 16, 2010, a 5- to 6-cm mass was noted approximately 15-cm from the anal verge.  This was concerning for malignancy, and thus multiple biopsies were taken.  Pathology review of this specimen revealed intramucosal adenocarcinoma in association with high-grade dysplasia.  There was no evidence of invasive disease noted.  Given this finding, Ms. Hogan was referred to Wilber Care Center of Pipestone for further evaluation and recommendations.
On further review of her history, Ms. Hogan does report an episode in March of 2010 where she had some right lower quadrant pain that was clinically consistent with appendicitis.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and a pelvic ultrasound revealed only an echogenic liver, a right ovarian cyst that was unchanged from prior examination, and no obvious cause for this pain.  It resolved spontaneously after one-week, and she has been without the pain since.
Ms. Hogan states that she continues to be asymptomatic, denying all the gastrointestinal symptoms as above as well as fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, headache, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptom.  Her ECOG performance status is 0.
