OUTSIDE RECORDS
Reviewed outside colonoscopy report.  I have requested his CT report and film to be over-nighted to Vanderee Chiropractic Home.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Distal rectal cancer, young-onset
Mr. Stankiewicz presents for evaluation and treatment of rectal cancer.  I discussed the development of cancer with the patient and his wife, including the need for endoscopic ultrasound to stage the tumor.  Would request tattooing of the distal margin and description in relation to the seminal vesicles to assist surgical planning.  After review with Dr. Sanchez, we will also repeat the colonoscopy with NBI imaging to evaluate for subtle neoplasia given his young-onset.  Also discussed Lynch syndrome, and patient is agreeable to immunohistochemistry staining to rule this out.  Therefore, I would request biopsies at the time of his colonoscopy to be obtained for this.  He had trouble with sedation during his first examination and therefore Anesthesia assistance will be requested.  Stoma nurse will be requested for education regarding colostomy versus temporary ileostomy, and patient will meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery.
#2 Elevated blood pressure
Blood pressure was 151/100, and therefore we will check a six-hour ambulatory.  Hypertension Clinic consultation is requested if persistent elevation is noted.
Discussed with Dr. Sanchez, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Young-onset distal rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Stankiewicz is a 45-year-old gentleman who presents for treatment of distal rectal cancer.  Mr. Stankiewicz normally enjoys good health until he developed hematochezia in May 2010.  His first colonoscopy June 14, 2010, was positive for a 4- to 5-mm polyp removed from the left colon at 70 cm (lost), and a fungating mass was noted in the distal rectum, described 3-cm above the anal verge.  Biopsies were taken, demonstrated grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma as described by Conley Hospital.  A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a prominent mass in the rectum but no evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease.  Mr. Stankiewicz denies any other complaints including no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight-loss, fever, melena, diarrhea, constipation, change in bowel habit, or rectal pain, or narrowed stool caliber.  His family history is negative for colorectal neoplasia.
His only chronic comorbidity is seasonal allergies, for which he uses occasional Claritin.  There is no history of cardiopulmonary symptoms or complaints, including no chest pain, pressure, discomfort, shortness-of-breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, or fatigue.  There is no history of bleeding disorder, anesthesia reaction, thrombosis, heart attack, stroke, glaucoma, sleep apnea, or malignant hypothermia.
