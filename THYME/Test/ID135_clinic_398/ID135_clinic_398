Based on our clinical exam, laboratory values, as well as CT imaging, we do not have any evidence of early tumor recurrence in Ms. Jandreau.  Our current CT-scan can serve as a new baseline for future comparison.
I outlined Ms. Lesher on the state of disease and highlighted the fact that a metastatic deposit at the diaphragm was resected which clearly puts the patient at a high-risk for an intra-abdominal recurrence in spite of the fact that the pelvic recurrence was resected with clear margins.  We then discussed the potential value of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.  If at all, I would recommend adjuvant capecitabine and not adjuvant FOLFOX or capecitabine/oxaliplatin as the best therapeutic option.  The patient has tolerated capecitabine in conjunction with her radiation therapy before quite well.  I would favor a four- to six-month duration of therapy with the conventional 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. two-weeks on, one-week off dose and schedule.  It is, however, clear that the treatment would rather delay than prevent the onset of metastasis if residual tumor material is still in the abdominal cavity.
Ms. Lesher could not commit to a decision on the adjuvant therapy at this point in time, and I think it is perfectly reasonable for her to think this over and discuss with her family over the next three-to-four weeks.  She will move back to Naples in early July and then set-up an appointment with her primary oncologist Dr. Amber Scott in Indianapolis Terra Bella, to further discuss these treatment considerations.
For now we are going to set-up the patient with Urology to discuss her bladder incontinence after the urologic resection.  I would be more than happy to see the patient back anytime in the future if questions arise.  For now she will pursue further oncologic care and follow-up appointments with her local oncologist Dr. Scott.

Ms. Lesher is a pleasant 79-year-old woman with a longstanding history of metastatic colon cancer which is outlined below.
1.  June 9, 2006, extended right hemicolectomy for grade 2 adenocarcinoma of the right transverse colon invading through the muscularis propria with focal extension through the visceral peritoneum; 1 of 23 pericolic lymph nodes positive, tumor staged per AJCC version 7, pT4a, N1a.
2.  July 2006 to January 2007 adjuvant therapy with FOLFOX, complication from peripheral neuropathy; it eventually resolved.
3.  May 2008, rising CEA; PET/CT-scan without any evidence of metastatic disease.
4.  September 2008, PET/CT-scan shows uptake in a complex/cystic soft-tissue density in the region of the vaginal cuff measuring 3-cm; subsequent CT-guided biopsy on October 16, 2008, reveals mucinous adenocarcinoma in the perivaginal mass consistent with colon cancer.
5.  December 29, 2008, to February 11, 2009, chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine as radiation sensitizer.  No further treatment afterwards.  Per CT criteria as well as PET uptake, good response of the pelvic mass.  CEA declined from 19.1 to 8.6.
6.  Early 2010, progression of the perirectal/perivaginal mass, intermittent bloody vaginal discharge.  Biopsy positive adenocarcinoma from a colon primary.  Patient scheduled to undergo resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is administered.
7.  April 14, 2010, initiated chemoradiation therapy with Xeloda 1000 mg by mouth twice-daily Monday through Friday, good tolerability.
8.  May 7, 2010, en bloc resection of pelvic recurrence with total prostatectomy, resection of posterior wall of vagina, portion of bladder, and right pelvic sidewall, partial cystectomy with primary bladder reconstruction, vaginectomy, closure of vagina, and intraoperative radiation therapy.  Surgical resection margins negative.  In addition, resection of a separate metastatic lesion at the right hemidiaphragm.  Pathology confirmed the presence of metastatic grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin in these areas.
Ms. Lesher now returns to Dickinson Hospital for a follow-up visit.  Upon presentation she stated that her main complaint relates to bladder incontinence in the absence of a feeling of bladder filling.  She has no pain and is slowly regaining her weight.  Appetite is still down.
