#1 Recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma with vaginal infiltration
Plan:
We will plan for a multi-disciplinary resection of her disease involving Gynecology, Urology, and Plastic surgery teams. She will also receive intraoperative radiation therapy. Bilateral ureteral stents will be placed before the operation. A complete discussion was had regarding risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained. She will be admitted to Pender Community Hospital hospital post-operatively for postoperative care.

Ms. Lesher is a 79-year-old female who initially underwent resection for transverse colon adenocarcinoma in 2006 which was followed by a course of chemotherapy. She presented with a pelvic mass in 2008 treated with chemotherapy and radiation and the lesion was felt to be unresectable at that time. She had been symptom-free since that time, until she presented to a gynecologic surgeon with vaginal bleeding. A biopsy revealed tumor infiltration of the vaginal cuff. A CT-scan shows no distant lesions. She remains otherwise asymptomatic.
