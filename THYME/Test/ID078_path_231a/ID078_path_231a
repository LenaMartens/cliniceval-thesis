Final Diagnosis
A.  Peritoneum, nodules, biopsy:  Involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.

B.	Small bowel, excision:  Serosa, muscularis propria and lamina propria involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.  The background small bowel mucosa is without diagnostic abnormality.

C.	Soft tissue, pelvic nodule, excision:  Involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.

D.  Abdomen, right lateral sidewall, excision:  Involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.

E.  Colon, portion of sigmoid, excision:  Serosa and muscularis propria involved by adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.  The background colonic mucosa is without diagnostic abnormality.

F.  Peritoneum, mesentery, resection:  Extracellular mucin present.  No viable tumor identified.

G.  Soft tissue, left anterior iliac tissue, excision:   Involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.

H.  Colon, ileocolonic anastomosis, excision:  Serosa, muscularis propria and lamina propria involved by adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.  The background small bowel and colonic mucosa are without diagnostic abnormality.

I.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Extracellular mucin present.  No viable tumor identified.

J.  Colon, anterior to descending, nodules, excision:  Involved by grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""peritoneal nodules"" is a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.0  Grossed by aggregate of red-tan fibrous tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by HOFFER.

B.	Received fresh labeled portion of small bowel is a 26 cm long portion of small bowel with 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm serosal mass with associated serosal adhesions.  The mucosa appears unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LAFFERTY

C.	Received fresh labeled left pelvic nodule is a 3.5 x 2.8 x 1.1 cm fragment of yellow-pink.  fibroadipose tissue with a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm white, glistening nodule.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by COFFEY.

D.	Received fresh labeled right lateral abdominal sidewall is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm fragment of pink-tan tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MATTHEWS.

E.  Received fresh labeled portion sigmoid colon is a long colon with an attached 8.0 cm long portion of colon with an attached 8.0 cm long portion of small bowel.  At the point of adhesion of the small bowel to the colon, there is a 3.0 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm tan white mass involving the serosa but not invading the muscularis.  The tumor is 1.7 cm from the nearest mucosal margin (small bowel).  The mucosa of the colon and small bowel is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MATTHEWS.

F.  Received fresh labeled mesentery is a 17.1 x 7.1 x 4.1 cm portion of pink-yellow mesentery.  No mass grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by JACKSON.

G.  Received fresh labeled left anterior iliac tissue is a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm portion of pink-tan tissue with a firm white-tan cut surface.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by MATTHEWS.

H.  Received fresh labeled ileocolonic anastomosis6.0 cm long portion of colon with a 3.5 cm long portion of small bowel.  A 3.1 x 2.9 x 1.7 cm mesenteric mass is present at the anastomosis.  The mass has a firm white cut surface.  The mucosal surfaces are unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MATTHEWS.

I.  Received fresh labeled omentum is a 11.0 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm portion of omentum.  No masses are identified grossly.  Lymph nodes are  identified.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MATTHEWS.

J.  Received fresh labeled anterior to descending colon nodules is a 7.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm fibroadipose tissue.  A firm necrotic area measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm is identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MEYER.
