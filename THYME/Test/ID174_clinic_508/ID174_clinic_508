#1 Young-onset sigmoid colon cancer
I agree with Nick Lankford's well-outlined recommendation, assessment, and treatment plan.  I discussed with Mr. Bailey and his wife the possibility of Lynch syndrome and gave them literature regarding this.  We do not have the tumor block from the biopsies done at his diagnostic colonoscopy.  He is agreeable to having a biopsy done at a sedated flex sig, and we will do that at the same time that he has his upper endoscopy to evaluate the two- to three-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  We will ask to have the immunostaining for DNA mismatch repair, proteins done as a rush so that we will have that information available, if possible, when he meets with Dr. Matthews from Colorectal Surgery.  If he does not have evidence of Lynch syndrome it may be reasonable to consider that he has attenuated FAP or MAP, and it may be reasonable for him to see Medical Genetics.  Another helpful piece of information may be to obtain the pathology slides themselves for the polyp taken at age 8 for review here to see if that lends any clues about his underlying genetic tendency for colorectal cancer.   We did discuss that sometimes for these hereditary conditions an ileorectostomy would be performed.  He is not too eager to consider that possibility.  He has a very active physical job and is concerned that if he had increased stool frequency that he would not be able to carry out his current work, which involves climbing electrical poles and a lot of physical activity.
#2 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
I did discuss with him weight-loss and dietary measures that could be done to evaluate this.  His liver will be evaluated undoubtedly with imaging for the coming years, and I did encourage him to try to follow these dietary measures once he is through his initial treatment for his colon cancer.

Mr. Bailey is a 31-year-old gentleman who was recently found to have sigmoid colon cancer.  This was detected when he underwent a colonoscopy because he was having bleeding and increased stool frequency.  He had a personal history at age 8 in 1986 of undergoing a colonoscopy for rectal bleeding, and he was found to have some type of polyp 20 cm from the anal verge. The pathology interpretation did not state clearly the polyp type.  He also had a proximal descending colon polyp that was removed.  It was 1.25 cm pedunculated tubular adenoma.  This was tattooed as was the site of the cancer itself, and he had another sigmoid tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia removed.  He had a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis that showed only the 4.3-cm sigmoid colon mass and the possibility of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  He does not drink alcohol at all.
He has a two-to-three year history of GERD which is partially treated with Ranitidine taken two times a day. He denies dysphagia or food impaction. His weight has been stable.
REVIEWED HIS PFH AND CVI AS OUTLINED PER NICHOLAS LANKFORD IN HIS NOTE TODAY.

His family history is positive for his father who was a smoker having died of lung cancer at age 55.  Maternal grandmother had pancreatic cancer in older age.  A paternal aunt had colorectal cancer in older age, and a paternal uncle had brain cancer in his late 50s.
