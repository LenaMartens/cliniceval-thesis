#1 Probable cecal carcinoma
See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Wallace, who also met with Mr. Dunn.  Please see her supervisory note.  Patient scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, colonoscopy.  I asked them to take more biopsies.  We will have his outside CT abdomen and pelvis 24 April 2010 reviewed here.  He is to visit with a colon and rectal surgeon next week.  Because of gout, hypertension, morbid obesity, I have ordered dobutamine stress ECHO.  Because of multiple triamcinolone injections and on prednisone, patient would need a steroid preparation preoperatively.
Spent 60 minutes with Mr. Dunn discussing all of the above, answering all questions.

#1 Probable cecal carcinoma
Mr. Dunn is a 56-year-old male who was seen at his local emergency room toward the end of April with severe abdominal pain.  He was found to have a hemoglobin of 9.9, and CT-scan 24 April 2010 showed distention of the cecum and ascending colon with minimal increased attenuation in the surrounding fat likely due to edema versus minimal inflammation.  He was treated for presumed colitis with Flagyl and Cipro.  He returned on 27 April 2010 and had a colonoscopy which noted inflammation of the cecum.  Biopsies show adenocarcinoma in-situ.  Pathology has been read here showing fragments of colonic mucosa with high-grade dysplasia.  He now comes to Ivanhoe General Hospital for further evaluation of the above.  He was offered right hemicolectomy closer to home.
