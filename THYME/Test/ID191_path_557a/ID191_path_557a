Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectosigmoid colon, resection:  Moderately differentiated 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 4.4 x 4.3 x 0.9 cm ulcerated mass.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The tumor extends to within 1.8 cm of the distal resection margin grossly.  Multiple 3 (of 13) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by GOSNELL.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3 N1b] (7th edition, 2010).

Seen in consultation with Dr. Mable S. Stephens.

Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by COST.

Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Rectosigmoid colon, resection:  Moderately differentiated 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 4.4 x 4.3 x 0.9 cm ulcerated mass.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The tumor extends to within 1.8 cm of the distal resection margin grossly.  Hold over for evaluation of lymph nodes on permanent sections.
