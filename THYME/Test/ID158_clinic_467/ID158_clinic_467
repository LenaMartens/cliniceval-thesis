Labs: August 2, 2010  Hemoglobin 14.2, WBC's 5.2, Platelets 232, Sodium 137, Potassium 4.1, Creatinine 0.7, Alk-Phos. 78, AST  22.
ECG: April 22, 2010 VENTRICULAR RATE 54 Sinus bradycardia. Nonspecific T-wave abnormality. No previous ECGs available.
August 2, 2010 CT-scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast:
Biphasic scanning through the liver. Liver cyst as seen on the outside CT of April 15, 2010. There is also a tiny cyst near the dome of the liver series 3 image 14 which is also stable. Small region of altered density in the liver adjacent to the falciform ligament series 3 image 37. Although technically indeterminate this very likely represents a region of so-called focal fatty infiltration. The patient's known rectal carcinoma is not optimally visualized. Degenerative changes at the lumbosacral interspace. Tiny region of bony sclerosis proximal right femur. Central catheter.
Rectal cancer status-post neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.
Plan: Robotic-assisted proctectomy, coloanal anastomosis, diverting loop ileostomy.

Mr. Quinn is a 46-year-old gentleman who developed rectal bleeding and underwent his first colonoscopy April 15, 2010.  A small polyp was removed from the sigmoid at 70 cm (tubular adenoma, low-grade dysplasia) and a partially obstructing mass was noted in the rectosigmoid extending from 12 to 15-cm above the anal verge.  Biopsies demonstrated invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma. A CT abdomen and pelvis of April 15, 2010, was negative for metastatic disease.  A-1.5-cm cyst was noted in the liver, and a 2-mm right pulmonary nodule was noted.  CEA was 2.  Mr. Quinn is symptomatic with persistent bright-red blood per rectum, increased fragmentation of stools, and also has had fevers and chills periodically for several weeks. He has completed his course of neoadjuvant therapy  and comes now for surgical management of the rectal cancer.
