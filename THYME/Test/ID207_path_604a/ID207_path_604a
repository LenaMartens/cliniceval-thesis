Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Biopsy site changes and tattoo site (0.6 x 0.5 cm) are present, located 8.4 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  No residual high grade dysplasia or carcinoma are identified.  A tubular adenoma (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) is also identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  A single (of 27) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pN1a] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid, rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 27.2 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon and rectum.  A 0.6 x 0.5 cm stellate area/biopsy site is present within the rectum, 8.4 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  There is also a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm polyp located 0.8 cm distal to the stellate area/biopsy site.  Multiple (approximately 30) lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat and are submitted for permanent sections only.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by QUIMBY.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal anastomotic ring"" is a 0.8 cm in length portion of colon.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by QUIMBY.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Biopsy site changes and tattoo site (0.6 x 0.5 cm) are present, located 8.4 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  No residual high grade dysplasia or carcinoma are identified.  A tubular adenoma (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) is also identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Hold over to process lymph nodes on permanent sections.
