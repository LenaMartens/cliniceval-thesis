Mr. Padro has a history of recurrent rectal cancer. He had an endoscopic resection of a T1, grade 3, low rectum adenocarcinoma arising in a polyp in August 2003. In July 2008, he presented with a rectal adenocarcinoma and liver metastases. He was treated with FOLFOX with Avastin for two-months followed by FOLFOX alone for one-month. On December 9, 2009, he underwent resection of his liver metastasis. Resection of the rectum with coloanal anastomosis. Postoperatively, he received additional chemotherapy. He completed this in April 2009. He had his diverting ileostomy reversed in September 2009.  He came in for routine checkup in December 2009 and was found to have relapse in his prior sites. This has been biopsy confirmed with regard to the presacral site. He comes now for surgical management of this recurrent rectal cancer.
