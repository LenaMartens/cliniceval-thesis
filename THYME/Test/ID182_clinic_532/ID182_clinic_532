LABORATORY
Reviewed colonoscopy report and radiology reports.
#1 Distal rectal cancer, status-post neoadjuvant chemoradiation
Mrs. Vargas presents for treatment of rectal cancer.  We discussed need for restaging, and she will proceed with laboratory work, chest x-ray, and CT abdomen and pelvis after which she will meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery for surgical recommendations.  Unfortunately, the lesion was not tattooed prior to her treatments.
#2 Possible von Willebrand disease
We will refer to Coagulation Clinic for evaluation of this preoperatively.
Discussed with Dr. Bert Owens.  Note to follow.

Distal rectal cancer, status-post neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Mrs. Vargas is a 62-year-old woman who presents for evaluation and treatment of distal rectal cancer.  Mrs. Vargas has a one-year history of hematochezia and then developed a mucus and narrowed stools.  She then sought medical evaluation where a-positive digital rectal examination was noted.  Her first colonoscopy April 20, 2010, was positive for an ulcerated mass described 2 to 3-cm from the anal verge.  This is described just inside the dentate line.  No synchronous lesions were identified, and pathology was positive for invasive grade 2 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Staging CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for evidence of metastatic disease.  An abnormality was noted in the pelvic region which was further evaluated on ultrasound, and no uterine myometrial lesions were seen.  It was determined Mrs. Vargas would require neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and therefore, she proceeded with preoperative chemoradiation May 24, 2010.  Unfortunately, she was involved in a head-on collision May 25, 2010, but was able to complete her therapies July 1, 2010.  The diarrhea and fatigue associated with treatment has improved significantly.  She had to have a cast on her ankle as a result of the accident but otherwise has no significant sequelae of this accident.  She received standard radiation of 5040 centigray in 28 fractions.  She presents now for surgical resection.  Restaging studies have not been performed.
Patient comorbidities include hypertension and hypothyroidism, but she does not currently use any medications.  She is allergic to penicillin, erythromycin, and adhesive tape.  She had quit smoking recently but now restarted over the past four days.  There is no history of heart attack, stroke, confirmed bleeding disorder, or anesthesia reaction.  Her daughter and granddaughter have von Willebrand disease, and she tends to bruise easily.  She has not had an evaluation for von Willebrand's.
