#1 Rectal adenocarcinoma, status-post neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy elsewhere
We will proceed with review of outside imaging studies, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colorectal surgery consultation.  Given the patient's recent episode of chest discomfort, we will also request cardiology evaluation.  Other impressions, recommendations as per Ms. Payne note.  All current questions answered.  See back as-needed for further discussion.

I have reviewed the chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical/surgical history, medications, drug allergies, family history, social history, review of systems, and physical examination findings in careful detail with Ms. Terra Franklin.  I agree with the substantive information included in Ms. Terra Franklin's note of today's date.
In brief, the key elements of Mr. Conde's history are that he recently underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy elsewhere for newly-diagnosed rectal cancer.  Pretreatment evaluation including CT-scan and PET scan showed question of liver metastases, although no uptake was noted on PET scan.  He presents now for further discussion regarding surgical planning.  Other details regarding past medical history, family history, and physical examination findings can be found in Ms. Franklin's note of today's date.
