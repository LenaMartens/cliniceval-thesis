#1 Rectal cancer, stage IV
This is incurable disease. The patient has poor prognosis features because the histology shows signet ring features. The diagnosis of metastatic disease was made based on a-positive thoracentesis fluid cytology that matched the cytology of the primary rectal cancer. In patients with good performance status, we would recommend systemic chemotherapy which, in this disease, is never curable but has shown to prolong survival. If the patient's performance status is decreased, we might still consider a regimen based on just an antibody treatment, but this is a specific decision which, after discharge of the patient, would be assessed in the outpatient oncology setting.
#2 Uterine cancer, stage I
This is probably stage 0 to I disease and certainly not the primary for the metastatic disease. This cancer diagnosis is relevant because it might be the main cause of her severe anemia.
#3 Anemia
The patient presented with severe anemia. This is certainly due to bleeding from either the uterine source and/or the rectal source. At the time of evaluation, I could not discern this from the history, and it seems that the other providers have also been uncertain about the source of the bleeding or whether these are two sources combined. We agree with the approach of transfusion which was already performed outside, and she might require additional transfusions here. The patient reports that she felt symptomatically improved with this approach. I suspect that the patient might have profound iron-deficiency as a result, and sending some iron studies might be reasonable in order to see whether she has any needs for iron supplementation.
#4 Bowel obstruction
I discussed Ms. Yount's care with the surgical resident. She is currently being treated on the Surgical Service for bowel obstruction. A surgical procedure to relieve this problem was entertained. I discussed with the Surgical Team that I would consider a colostomy rather than a rectal cancer resection because, in the situation of metastatic disease, our main focus is local control and it is unclear to me whether the patient would benefit in terms of local control in symptoms by having a perhaps more complicated oncological resection of the primary tumor.
#5 Control of the bleeding
If the bleeding source is determined to be the uterus, then we could make recommendations for hormonal treatment of the stage I uterine cancer. It might also be advisable to consult the Gyn Oncology Service to see whether they can perform another curettage or recommend another local procedure. If the bleeding persists from either one of the two tumor sources, we could also consider Radiation Oncology consult with the goal of just controlling the symptoms.

I saw this patient together with Dr. Long. I agree with the history, physical exam, and assessment and plan documented in her consultation note dated October 29, 2010.
This was a consultation from the Surgical Service for assessment of a new diagnosis of rectal cancer.

Ms. Yount is a 72-year-old woman who has not seen a doctor for the past 40 years and came to the attention of an outside medical center where she presented with fatigue and was found to be severely anemic with a hemoglobin of about 5. At the outside hospital, a CT-scan was performed that led to the suspicion of rectal cancer. A pleural effusion was also found to be present and was approached with a thoracentesis procedure.
