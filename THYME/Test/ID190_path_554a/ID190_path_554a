Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, resection:  Invasive (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming an 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm ulcerative and annular mass in the sigmoid colon, situated 3.0 cm from the nearest mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis and visceral peritoneum and extends to abut the radial margin in the region of the ureter.  The proximal and distal mucosal margins are negative for tumor.  A single (of 51) regional lymph node is positive for adenocarcinoma.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT4aN1] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Colon, abdominal, segmental resection:  Dilated colon without specific histologic abnormality.  Multiple (6) benign regional lymph nodes are identified.  The appendix is unremarkable.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a 24.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon.  There is an 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm ulcerative annular mass 3.0 cm from the nearest mucosal margin. The mass spans a segment of bowel 8.0 cm in length.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat and involves the visceral peritoneum with perforation.   Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by ALLEN.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""abdominal colon"" is a 102.0 cm in length segment of colon with a 6.2 x 0.4 cm appendix and a 5.6 cm segment of ileum.  The colon luminal diameter is 7.1 cm, and the mucosa is diffusely edematous.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BRADY.
