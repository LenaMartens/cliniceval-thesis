#1 Rectal cancer
See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Williams who also met with Mr. Smallwood and his wife.  Please see his supervisory note.  We will have his outside CT abdomen and pelvis 25 February 2010 read here.  Patient scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, rectal ultrasound, Colon and Rectal Surgery, Medical and Radiation Oncology.  The patient is okay anesthesia from my standpoint with no cardiopulmonary issues other than hypertension.  I did speak to Mr. Smallwood about testing for immunohistochemical stain and is unsure if he wants this done or not due to financial considerations.
Spent 60 minutes with Mr. Smallwood discussing all of the above, answering all questions.

#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Smallwood is a 38-year-old African-American male who noticed hematochezia for approximately six-months.  His stools became looser and more frequent.  This led to colonoscopy 24 February 2010 which showed a mass measuring 3-cm, partially circumferential, involving one-third of the lumen 8 to 8.5 cm from the anal verge.  The mass measured 3-cm in length.  Sigmoid, descending, splenic flexure, transverse colon, hepatic flexure, ascending colon, cecum, and ileocecal valve all normal.  Outside pathology has been read here showing invasive grade 3 to 4 adenocarcinoma associated with fragments of tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  CT abdomen and pelvis 25 February 2010 shows the circumferential mass-like thickening distal rectosigmoid colon.  Possible 4-mm lymph node seen within the paracolonic fat.  In addition, a couple of punctate subcentimeter in long axis internal iliac chain lymph nodes on the left, none of which appear to be pathologically enlarged, as well as minimally prominent external iliac chain lymph nodes bilaterally on the left.  Fatty infiltration on the liver seen.  No other abnormalities seen.  The patient comes to Enloe Hospital for treatment.  CEA at-home in February was 5.6.
