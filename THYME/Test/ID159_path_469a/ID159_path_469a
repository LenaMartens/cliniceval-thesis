Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, abdominal wall, biopsy:  Dense fibrous tissue; no tumor seen.

B.  Lymph node, ileal mesenteric apical, biopsy:  A single lymph node is negative for tumor.

C.  Small bowel, ileum with mesenteric lymph nodes, segmental resection:  Multiple (8 of 18) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.  Portion of ileum with adhesions; unremarkable ileal mucosa.

D.  Lymph nodes, left iliac, lymphadenectomy:  A single (1 of 5) left iliac lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

E.  Small bowel, segmental resection:  Small bowel mucosa with ulceration and granulation tissue. There is a single detached fragment of granulation tissue with a small focus of adenocarcinoma.  Multiple (6 of 7) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

F.  Rectum, top of rectum, excision:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.4 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm mass.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into perirectal fat.  

G.  Soft tissue, pelvic tumor, excision:  Involved by grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

H.  Rectum and anus, resection:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.2 x 3.6 x 2.0 cm ulcerated mass at the dentate line, located 2.7 cm from the distal anal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into perirectal fat.  The distal anal margin and radial margin are negative for tumor. 

I.  Rectum, proximal tumor, excision:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm ill-defined fibrotic mass and invading through the muscularis propria.

J.  Soft tissue, right pelvic sidewall, excision:  Negative for tumor.

K.  Soft tissue, pelvic tumor No. 2, excision:  Involved by grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

L.  Soft tissue, pelvic tumor No. 3, excision:  Involved by grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

M.  Soft tissue, right pelvic sidewall margin, excision:  Involved by grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with rectal primary.

N.  Small bowel, ileum, segmental resection:  Unremarkable ileal mucosa with serosal adhesions.

O.  Colon and small bowel, right hemicolectomy:  Multifocal active enteritis with focal ulceration (3.0 x 2.0 cm, located 30.5 cm from the proximal margin; 5.3 x 4.7 cm, located 38.0 cm from the proximal margin), changes consistent with chemoradiation; negative for tumor.  The appendix and colonic mucosa are unremarkable.  Multiple (20) regional lymph nodes are negative.  Seen in consultation with Dr. Morgan T. Bostrom.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""abdominal wall tissue, rule out ca"" is a 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm portion of tan-white soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by TURNER

B.  Received fresh labeled ""ileal mesenteric apical lymph node"" is a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by TURNER

C.  Received fresh labeled ""ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes"" is an 11.3 cm segment of small bowel with serosal adhesions.  The mucosa is unremarkable.  There is a 3.7 x 2.3 x 2.3 cm grossly positive lymph node with multiple adjacent smaller suspicious lymph nodes.  Multiple (18) lymph nodes are identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ROBISON.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""left iliac lymph nodes"" is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of lymph node tissue.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by LOPEZ.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel"" is an 18.5 x 6.0 cm segment of small bowel.  The segment is dilated and has a longitudinal opening 5.0 cm in length.  The mucosa has multiple (15) small polyps/nodules.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MCBEE.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""top of rectum"" is a 5.4 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm portion of fibrotic red-tan tissue.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by TURNER

G.  Received fresh labeled ""pelvic tumor"" is a 3.5 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm portion of fibrous white tissue.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by TURNER

H.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and anus"" is a 7.2 cm segment of rectum and anus.  There is a 5.2 x 3.6 x 2.0 cm ulcerated mass present at the proximal margin, at the dentate line, and 2.7 cm from the anal skin margin.  There is no perirectal adipose tissue (muscle only) on this specimen and therefore there are no lymph nodes.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by ROBISON.

I.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal rectal tumor"" is a 3.9 x 3.0 x 1.7 cm portion of tan-red-yellow tissue with a portion of bowel wall muscle.  There is a 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm ill-defined fibrotic mass.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by ROBISON.

J.  Received fresh labeled ""right pelvic sidewall tissue"" is a 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm unoriented portion of tan-red fibrous tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by ROBISON.

K.  Received fresh labeled ""pelvic tumor #2"" is a 2.9 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm portion of firm white-tan tissue.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by MCBEE.

L.  Received fresh labeled ""pelvic tumor #3"" is a 4.2 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm portion of firm white-tan tissue.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by MCBEE.
