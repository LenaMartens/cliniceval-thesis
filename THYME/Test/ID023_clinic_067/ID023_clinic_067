#1 Colon cancer
-Subsequent to medical stabilization of her CHF and renal dysfunction patient will require exploration and likely a right vs. extended right hemicolectomy; given her comorbidities, relatively large/protruberant abdomen, multiple prior abdominal surgeries, and uncertainly of the location of the tumor, will likely require open as opposed to a laparoscopic approach.
-Will discuss with Dr. Ballard re: timing of surgery but certainly her medical condition needs optimization prior and medical clearance..
-We will follow along from England Clinic and remain available please do not hesitate to call me with questions; I will follow-up with later this week for definitive surgical planning.

Mrs. Romano is a 82-year-old kidney transplant, vasculopathic patient who is in active CHF and with a complex past medical and surgical history. She developed IDA, work-up revealed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma "in the right colon or distal transverse colon" according to Dr. Harper colonoscopy report. Subsequent to the colonoscopy prep she developed acute graft dysfunction, received several units of blood for her anemia, and then developed acute CHF. We are consulted for surgical treatment recommendations. Patient is moving her bowels, passing flatus, no vomiting but sometimes feels nauseated and full. She understands she needs surgery and wishes to proceed.
CT-scan failed to reveal any obvious abdominopelvic metastases or worrisome lymphadenopathy: CT: ORIGINAL REPORT - 18-Jun-2010 18:07:00   Hartley Hospital
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast. IV contrast was not administered given the patient's renal insufficiency. Comparison with
prior abdomen/pelvis CT 5/16/2009. Minimal gaseous distention of a loop of small-bowel in the right hemiabdomen without definite transition point to suggest obstruction. Remainder of the small-bowel is decompressed. The recently-diagnosed circumferential colonic mass representing biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma
is not well demonstrated on this exam. No free intraperitoneal air. No free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis. The appendix is well-visualized
and is normal. New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, right-greater-than-left. Interval postoperative changes
of screw fixation of a left femoral neck fracture. Otherwise, no interval change. Cholecystectomy. Atrophy of the native kidneys
bilaterally. Right lower quadrant renal transplant. Few scattered, nonenlarged lymph nodes throughout the mesentery, the largest near the
cecum measuring 8mm. Atherosclerotic vascular calcifications including coronary artery calcifications. Thoracolumbar scoliosis with extensive
degenerative changes. Stable sclerosis throughout the right sacrum compatible with history of insufficiency fractures. Old healed left
pubic rami fractures. Lower lumbar laminectomies. Dynamic hip screw right hip. Degenerative changes pubic symphysis, both SI joints, and
both hips. Multiple calcified injection granulomas in the subcutaneous tissues of both buttocks. Remainder negative.
