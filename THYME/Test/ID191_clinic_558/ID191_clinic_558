#1 Resected T3, N1 (3 of 13) sigmoid adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Huff Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Miller, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Mr. Moriarty has a very complicated situation.  We would at this point recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX.  Dr. Miller will visit with Mr. Moriarty prior to dismissal for formal recommendations.  Mr. Moriarty will plan on pursuing adjuvant therapy closer to home in Ansonville North Carolina.  Therefore, I have not made follow-up appointments for him and certainly if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to facilitate care.
PATIENT EDUCATION:
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mr. Moriarty is a very pleasant 56-year-old male from Diamond Point New York.  He has a prior past medical history significant for morbid obesity, type-2 diabetes (with diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy in the lower extremities), hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  He has a baseline creatinine of 7.5 with a GFR of 15.
1.  August 2010 referred to the Sunrise Canyon Center for evaluation of possible kidney transplant.  CT imaging done (without contrast due to baseline kidney function) showed a thickening in the distal colon.
2.  August 30, 2010, underwent colonoscopy (first ever) identifying a sigmoid mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  October 6, 2010, taken by Dr. Bellanger for a low-anterior resection.  Surgical pathology identifying a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat 4.4 x 4.3 x 0.9-cm in size.  Three of 13 lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, negative surgical margins.  Staged at T3, N1b.
Mr. Moriarty is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up ambulating during our consultation.  His overall kidney function has improved while hospitalized.  He has been followed by our colleagues in Nephrology who at this point have not recommended or initiated dialysis.  He is on the transplant list in Ansonville North Carolina.  He had no preoperative CEA.
