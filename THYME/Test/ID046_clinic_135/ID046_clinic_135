I carefully reviewed with Mrs. Hilliard and her husband the natural history of both colon and rectal cancer and their differences.  She has early disease, T2, N0 of high rectal tumor or rectosigmoid (stage 1).  There is no need for adjuvant chemotherapy, neither radiation therapy.  This was also discussed over the phone with Dr. Cody Lemus from Radiation Oncology.  The patient and her husband were very pleased with this recommendation.
We will see the patient in follow-up in about four to six-months together with Dr. Orozco.  I wrote the orders for this to be coordinated in a single visit to see both Hematology and Oncology.  CBC, chemistries, CEA, chest CT, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis were also ordered.

Stage I rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

July 1, 2010:  Low-anterior resection for a T2, N0, grade 3 (of 4), high rectal versus rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma (negative margins and none of the 30 resected lymph nodes contained metastasis).
I had the pleasure to see Mrs. Hilliard.  She was initially seen by the GI Consult Team after recent surgery by Carolee Feder, N.P.  I will refer the reader to her excellent note.  Mrs. Hilliard has recovered from surgery without any complications and is up and about and asymptomatic.  A postoperative CT showed no evidence of evidence nor did chest x-ray.  CBC and chemistries are unremarkable including CEA.
The medical history is significant for large-cell lymphoma diagnosed in January 2000, had a CR with CHOP.  Later there was enlargement of a lymph node that biopsy showed to be follicular grade 2, which was treated with two doses of Zevalin, and since then she has been in remission.  She is followed by Dr. Orozco in Hematology.
