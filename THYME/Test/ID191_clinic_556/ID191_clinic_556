Mr. Moriarty is a gentleman who was being seen by Nephrology for kidney transplantation who has subsequently during his workup unfortunately been diagnosed with likely sigmoid colon cancer as well as a cecal polyp.  Pathology is pending, but given the endoscopic description and the CT-scan, it is undoubtedly sigmoid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with him regarding surgery which would require a segmental colectomy.  It is unlikely that he would require a colostomy.  At this time point, I think that any reasonable colorectal surgeon could perform this operation.  It will likely be an open operation given the patient's size, and this has all been described to him in detail.  He has my card and may contact us for a surgery or further information.  I would be happy to talk to him or his wife regarding this finding.  He has been well-informed at this time point.  We will continue to work with Dr. Henning to provide him the full results of his pathology once they are available to us.
