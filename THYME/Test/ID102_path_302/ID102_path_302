Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 5.2 x 4.1 x 1.2 cm polypoid mass located 2.1 cm from the distal margin, which is histologically negative.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Multiple (2) tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia (1.1 cm and 0.7 cm) are also identified. The proximal and distal surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (2 of 42) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCCpT3N1MX]. 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
