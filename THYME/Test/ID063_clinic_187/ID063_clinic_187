#1 Resected synchronous colorectal carcinomas
I reviewed these findings with Mrs. Henderson and her husband.  We went over her current clinical findings.  She continues to improve with strength day by day.  Her wound will likely improve in the coming weeks, and her final drain should be removed.  She is seeing Dr. Cain later today.  She can make further recommendations on the postoperative wound care management.
We discussed further adjuvant treatment for her resected colorectal carcinomas.  Her right-sided lesion was a T2, N1 tumor with 1 (of 57) node-positive.  The midrectal tumor was a T3, N2 with 7 positive nodes.  Given these pathologic findings, we would recommend use of adjuvant FOLFOX for at least six-months.  I went over potential side-effects as well as logistics of the treatment.  She will need central catheter placement.  We talked about potential side-effects of the FOLFOX chemotherapy.  We would likely initiate this within the next month or so depending on her further recovery.  She is also set-up to see Radiation Oncology later this morning.  They will make recommendations on use of radiation therapy in this setting as well.
For now, she plans to return home for further convalescence.  She can get an appointment with her local oncologist.  If indeed she returns in the coming weeks to see Colorectal Surgery, I would be happy to see her back to answer any further questions.  Her questions were answered.
#2 Family history of colorectal carcinoma
We did discuss this briefly.  She did have HNPCC screening performed, and this was negative.  I talked about formal genetics consult in her situation.  This can always be considered in the future, and we would be happy to help arrange for this.

#1 Resected synchronous colorectal carcinomas
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  July 9, 2010--Due to abdominal pain, presented to her local primary-care provider.  She also had intermittent episodes of bright-red blood per stool.  Recommending further workup.
2.  July 26, 2010--Colonoscopy performed noting a 4-cm sessile nonobstructing mass located 15-cm in the rectosigmoid junction.  A second lesion was identified within the cecum was ulcerated and friable.  Both of these lesions were positive for grade 3 (of 4) infiltrating carcinoma.  Mismatch repair testing performed noting intact expression of the four mismatched repair proteins making this likely not a HNPCC lesion.
3.  July 29, 2010--CEA at 1.2.
4.  July 30, 2010--CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noting small axillary, mediastinal, and hilar adenopathy.  Two tiny lesions in the liver too small to characterize.  Increased soft-tissue density at the level of the ileocecal valve.
5.  August 3, 2010--PET scan performed noting increased uptake at the ileocecal valve and the rectosigmoid region.  This scan was reviewed by Mercy Family Nursing Home radiologists and state that there is an additional 1-cm moderate left-sided presacral and upper left interval iliac lymphadenopathy.  A-1.1-cm nodule in the upper-outer right breast, very low-level uptake, suspicious for fibroadenoma or lymphadenopathy, less likely a lobular carcinoma.  Recommended a mammography.
6.  August 25, 2010--Dr. Cain performed a low-anterior resection and a right hemicolectomy.  Operative pathology of the low-anterior resection was positive for moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma located in the rectum.  Tumor invaded into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic and vascular invasion was present.  Of 30 regional lymph nodes removed, 7 were positive for metastatic disease.  Resected margins were negative (T3, N2).  Pathology of the right hemicolectomy was also positive for moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma located within the cecum.  Tumor invaded into the muscularis propria.  Surgical resected margins were negative.  Of 57 regional lymph nodes removed, 1 was positive for metastatic disease (pT2, N1).
7.  Postoperatively, the patient had complications with wound dehiscence and required a second operation on September 2, 2010.  She had anastomotic leak in the ileocolic anastomosis and underwent extensive irrigation of the abdomen.  Drains were placed.
She now returns for further evaluation.  She is feeling better day by day.  Her energy level is improving.  She did have a drain removed yesterday.  Ostomy appears to be functioning well.  She does have a good appetite and is slowly gaining back weight.  She has lost about 20 to 25 pounds over the course of her illness.
