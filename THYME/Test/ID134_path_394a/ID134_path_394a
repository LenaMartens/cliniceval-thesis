Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (3.4 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm) located 3.2 cm from the distal surgical  margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (3 of 28) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Multiple (2) soft tissue deposits of adenocarcinoma are identified.

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2009).

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in ZWKM AitwNzlc.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum, portion sigmoid colon"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 32.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  The radial margin is inked.  A 3.4 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm ulcerative mass is present within the distal aspect, 3.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 0.9 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by GODINES.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""final distal rectal margin"" is a 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm portion of mucosal tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by CARSON
