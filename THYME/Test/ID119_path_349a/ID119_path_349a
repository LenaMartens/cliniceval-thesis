Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 5.3 x 3.6 x 1.4 cm ulcerative exophytic mass in the rectum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the subserosa.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 2.3 cm of the radial resection margin.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. Multiple (4 of 30) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Multiple (17) diverticula are present in the sigmoid colon.  [AJCC ypT3N2]

B.  Colon, proximal sigmoid anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic anastomotic ring.

C.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable rectal anastomotic ring.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon and rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 40.2 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon and rectum.  A 5.3 x 3.6 x 1.4 cm ulcerative and exophytic mass is present within the rectum, 3.8 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin, and 2.3 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (34) potential lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  There are also multiple (17) diverticula in the sigmoid colon.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WESTERVELT.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon and rectum; proximal anastomotic ring"" is a 1.1 cm proximal sigmoid anastomotic ring.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WESTERVELT.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon and rectum; distal anastomotic ring"" is a 0.8 cm distal rectal anastomotic ring.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WESTERVELT.
