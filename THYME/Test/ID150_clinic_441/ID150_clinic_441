Reviewed outside colonoscopy and pathology reports.
I have reviewed the patient's medications.
IMPRESSION
#1 Distal rectal cancer
Mr. Klassen is referred for further treatment of rectal cancer.  I shared with him Camelot Medical Center Pathology diagnosis which was new to him.  He has had no staging.  I discussed the development, staging, and treatment of rectal cancer with the patient and his son, Pqt.  We will proceed with lab work, CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and EUS followed by Colorectal Surgery consultation.  If T3 or N1 disease is noted, he will also be asked to meet with Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology.  I will follow-up with the patient after his EUS for test results, and a CEA will also be requested.
#2 Progressive reflux symptoms
EGD will be requested to be performed at the time of his EUS, if this can be facilitated on his calendar.  If not, this can be considered at some time in the future with a future endoscopy.
#3 Actinic keratoses
The patient has numerous skin changes consistent with actinic keratoses, but given the extent he would benefit from a dermatologic evaluation.  The patient has been advised but declined a formal consultation at this time.  He can certainly pursue this closer to home in the future.
#4 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfied, the patient is okay for anesthesia.  He should take his metoprolol the morning of surgery with a sip of water.  I have requested his prior cardiology records.
Discussed with Dr. Lena Diggs, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mr. Klassen is a 75-year-old gentleman who presents for treatment of rectal cancer.  Mr. Klassen underwent his first colonoscopy March 16, 2010, for screening purposes, and three lesions were identified; two 3- to 4-mm polyp were removed from the distal sigmoid and rectum, tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia on pathology.  A 3-cm flat, subtle, distal rectal polyp at the dentate was noted and biopsied, described as soft and not nodular.  Biopsies on outside pathology were indeterminate for adenocarcinoma; however, Camelot Medical Center pathology has reviewed the slides and described invasive grade 2 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Klassen is referred for further evaluation and treatment.  He has remained asymptomatic from a lower GI standpoint with no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight-loss, fever, hematochezia, melena, diarrhea, constipation, or change in bowel habits other than some increased gas production.  He has had reflux symptoms for several years, and these seem to be getting worse.  EGD has never been performed, and prior treatment with Prilosec was not felt to be of much help.  He currently is using District of Columbia, often two-to-three times a day.  His family history was negative for known colorectal neoplasia, although his sister just died within the past year of some type of abdominal cancer.
Comorbidities include a history of coronary artery disease for which he underwent double vessel bypass graft in 2008 along with a valve replacement (question mitral valve).  He has hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension all of which are managed with diet and medication.  There is no history of bleeding disorders or anesthesia reactions.  He is allergic to penicillin and does not smoke.
