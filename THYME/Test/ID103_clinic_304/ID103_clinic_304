#1 Metastatic urothelial cancer with metastases as per PET scan to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well as inguinal lymph nodes and upper iliac chain bilaterally
I had a lengthy conversation with Mr. Newsome and his daughter.  I told the patient that based on this evaluation and the results of the PET scan, he has cancer with metastases to the retroperitoneal as well as iliac and retrocrural lymph nodes.  I told the patient that my recommendation for him is to undergo treatments with chemotherapy.  We discussed the potential treatment options that included for him to participate in a clinical trial or treatment with standard chemotherapy.  Told Mr. Newsome that if he desires for standard chemotherapy, my recommendation for him is to receive weekly gemcitabine with about two-weeks on and a week off or three weeks on and a week off.  Also recommended the patient to have this treatment close to home as this requires weekly trips to Pella Regional Clinic for treatments.  We discussed that urothelial cancer in general are tumors that are very chemosensitive but that there is a very low or minimal chance of a cure with this stage of the disease.  Mr. Newsome is to make an appointment to see a local oncologist in anticipation for future chemotherapy treatments.  This case was discussed with Drs Guerrero and Taylor in th GU oncology group.
#2 Increased uptake in the thyroid gland
I suspect that Mr. Newsome likely has a thyroid cancer.  There is some increased uptake seen in the PET scan.  I am referring Mr. Newsome for evaluation by Endocrinology as well as potential needle biopsy of his thyroid gland.
#3 Increased uptake in the colon
I personally reviewed the PET scan as well as the whole-body CT-scan done along with the PET scan.  The patient has a prior history of colonic polyposis, and I think at this point it is appropriate to proceed with a colonoscopy to rule-out the possibility of another polyp or even a malignant tumor in the colon.  The patient is in agreement.  He was actually told before that he needed a colonoscopy.  Mr. Newsome wants to have this colonoscopy also done here at-home.  I will communicate these results to the patient once they are available.  Mr. Newsome understands that I will be out of the country for the next five days.

Mr. Newsome has been seen at the request of Dr. Pelham (Urologist) because of his newly-diagnosed metastatic urothelial cancer.  The patient's history is as follows:
He is a delightful 86-year-old male who has a prior history of prostate cancer.  Reports that in 1990 he was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  At that time, he underwent RRP with a-positive margin.  His surgery was followed by external radiation therapy with an unknown dose.  He then had some follow-ups done by his local physician at-home.  In January 2008, the patient underwent cystoscopy and at that time he was found to have CIS on TURBT.  He had received treatment with BCG for a total of six-weeks (late summer, early fall 2008).  By February 2009, repeat of the TURBT demonstrated grade 3, T1 urothelial carcinoma but again no muscle invasion was identified at the time.  The patient was advised to undergo a re-resection but he continued having the BCG as a way to avoid cystectomy.   A second course of BCG was given again for six-weeks.  By December 2009, a repeat of the TURBT demonstrated grade 3, T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  By February 2010, a recurrent lesion resulted in a repeat of the TURBT demonstrating invasive urothelial carcinoma of t bladder.  On March 2, 2010, the patient underwent PET scan imaging for staging of his urothelial cancer.  This one was compared to the prior diagnostic CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated January 25, 2010.  This PET scan was concerning by the presence of increased FDG uptake in the thickened left bladder wall consistent with the documented bladder malignancy.  In addition, there was focus of activity present at the dome of the bladder that also represents likely tumor involvement.  There is also FDG avid lymphadenopathy in the upper iliac chain bilaterally, in the retroperitoneum, and in the right retrocrural area.  All of this is concerning for metastatic disease.  Other findings on this PET scan included an increase focus of activity in the descending colon (this patient has a prior history of colonic polyp positive) as well as increased area of the activity in the thyroid gland which is particularly concerning for being another malignancy.
On March 3, 2010, the patient was referred to GSM.
