#1 Metastatic rectal carcinoma to lymph node
I reviewed these findings with Mrs. Camara and her son.  We went over her current CT-scan findings.  Intra-abdominally, there is no definite evidence of recurrence.  Postoperative changes are noted.  Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule has increased in size.  This is consistent with a potential metastatic site.  I told her that I was concerned that she likely has other disease elsewhere.  I suspect that "adjuvant" chemotherapy would likely not be benefit in this setting.  She is currently too weak to consider combination chemotherapy.  There is no rush to start any treatment at that point.  One could consider continued observation or consider a 5-FU-based therapy once she is healed.  Low-dose capecitabine would be an option or possibly a 5-FU-based therapy.  She is hoping for any treatment closer to home.  We will try to get her set-up in Virginia, at least for an initial evaluation.  She may not wish to consider chemotherapy immediately.  One could always consider followup CT-scan in a few months' time.  She is aware that given 16 positive region nodes, she is at very high-risk for recurrence elsewhere.  Combination chemotherapy in this setting may be too toxic for the patient.  Questions were answered, and I will also discuss the case with Dr. Smith next week.  We will initially try to get her into Fairmont in the next three-to-four weeks.

#1 Metastatic rectal carcinoma to lymph node
Mrs. Camara returns following her surgery.  She underwent a surgical resection last month following her five-day course of radiation therapy.  She was found to have a T4, N2 tumor with 16 positive regional nodes.  This included tumor deposits in the pericolonic fat.  She has slowly recovered from surgery and is now returning for reevaluation.
#2 Pulmonary nodule
This was noted preoperatively.  She denies any new respiratory symptoms.
