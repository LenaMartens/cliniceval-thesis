#1 Rule-out gastrointestinal bleeding
Mr. Newsome's history of having melena almost on a daily basis and associated with a prior history of a left hemicolectomy (April 26) for a T3, N0, MX adenocarcinoma of the colon is concerning.  In addition to this, the patient has orthostasis.  His bradycardia is most likely related to the ongoing use of beta-blockers.  He also has abdominal distention.  Some symptoms to me are concerning for gastric outlet obstruction.  The patient reports having minimal oral intake; and even after minimal meals, he has abdominal distention, nausea; and all of the symptoms are relieved by the patient having an episode of vomiting.  I discussed with Mr. Newsome and his two daughters that at this point my recommendation for him is to be evaluated at the ER for evaluation for potential admission.  His main issues are his ongoing GI bleeding as well as the symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction.  He is also status-post a left hemicolectomy and has also an unresectable urothelial carcinoma.  He also has indeterminate liver lesions that to me are concerning for being metastases from his urothelial cancer.  I had discussed in the past with Mr. Newsome that he is not a surgical candidate for his urothelial cancer and that if any treatment is going to be done will require the patient to have a better performance status.  In the current condition, the patient is not a candidate for active treatment with chemotherapy.  I have referred the patient for evaluation at ER.

I was asked by Dr. Lease to see Mr. Newsome as a follow-up from his colon cancer surgery.  The patient has an oncologic history significant for at least three cancers:
#1 Urothelial carcinoma, metastatic, nonresectable
#2 History of prostate cancer
#3 History of a resected T3, N0, MX colorectal cancer (resected on April 26, 2010)
The patient is a delightful 86-year-old male who has a prior history of prostate cancer.  In 1990, he was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  At that time, he underwent RRP with a-positive margin.  His surgery was then followed by external radiation therapy with an unknown dose.  He then had follow-ups by his local physician at-home.  In January 2008, the patient underwent cystoscopy; and at that time he had CIS on TURBT.  He received treatment with BCG for a total of six-weeks (late summer as well as early fall 2008).  By February 2009, a repeat of the TURBT demonstrated grade 3, T1 urothelial carcinoma; but there was no evidence of muscle invasion at the time.  At that time, the patient was advised to undergo a reresection, but he continued having BCG as a way to avoid cystectomy.   A second week of BCG was given again for another six-week period.  By December 2009, a repeat of the TURBT demonstrated grade 3, T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  PET scan examination done at that time revealed disease involving the bladder.  He then visited with Dr. Pelham who considered that due to his multiple comorbidities the patient was not a candidate for an aggressive surgery.  Of note, the PET scan demonstrated avid lymphadenopathy in the upper iliac chain bilaterally, in the retroperitoneum, as well as right retrocrural area.   Of note, there was also activity in the descending colon that was suspicious to me for being a new malignancy.  March 3, 2010, the patient underwent colonoscopy.  At that time, a proximal sigmoid ulcerated neoplasia was seen consistent with a primary adenocarcinoma of the colon.  The pathology report demonstrated tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia in the transverse proximal colon.  In the descending colon, there was tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  In the sigmoid colon, there was tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
On April 26, 2010, Dr. Chris Lease took the patient to the operating room.  At that time, the patient underwent hand-assisted left colectomy with mobilization of the splenic flexure as well as intraoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy and intraabdominal omental pedicle flap.  Pathology report on that surgical specimen showed invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.8- x 3- x 1.2-cm ulcerative as well as polypoid mass in the left colon 9.3 cm from the nearest mucosal margin.  Tumor was seen invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Focus suspicious for lymphatic/vascular invasion was also seen.  Surgical resection margins were negative.  Staging of this tumor was considered to be a T3, N0, MX.  Patient's postoperative period was complicated by hyperkalemia.  He had potassium levels of 7.3 and was transferred to the ICU.  He was also found to have exacerbation of his chronic kidney disease.  On April 29, 2010, the patient was discharged home.  He was readmitted again on May 10, 2010, due to dehydration, diarrhea, as well as worsening chronic renal insufficiency.  Of note, during that hospital admission, the patient complained about having early satiety and feeling nauseated after eating.  He also mentions to me that he complained about having episodes of melena.  On May 14, 2010, the patient was discharged home, and two-weeks later he received a blood transfusion of 2 units of blood.  He reports feeling much better after the blood transfusion but a few days later still having abdominal distention, nausea, some vomiting, as well as early satiety.  He also mentions to me having noticed at least one episode of black stools every day.  Mr. Newsome called Dr. Lease who then called me and asked me to evaluate the patient today.
