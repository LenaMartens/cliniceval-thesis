#1 T3, N1, M0 sigmoid carcinoma, status-post resection
I reviewed Mr. Burns's medical history.  I also reviewed his outside CT-scan by myself and with Dr. Guerrero.
I discussed the case in detail with Dr. Guerrero.
I met with Mr. Burns and his wife today.  We had a long discussion regarding the recent diagnosis of sigmoid cancer, the significance of stage and grade, prognosis, and survival data.  We discussed relapse risk with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.  I went over adjuvant chemotherapy regimens with him.  It is our recommendation that at this time he undergo adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy for six-months.  I discussed the FOLFOX regimen as well as the capecitabine regimen with him.  We discussed about the risks versus benefits of chemotherapy.
Mr. Burns has not yet decided whether he would like to undergo chemotherapy.  He has an appointment with his local oncologist this following week.  If he undergoes chemotherapy, he would like to do that close to home.
All questions answered.
