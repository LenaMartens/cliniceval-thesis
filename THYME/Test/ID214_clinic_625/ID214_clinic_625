Ms. Dossett is a 37-year-old lady with newly-diagnosed rectal carcinoma.  She presented late in May with hematochezia. She also noticed a change in her bowel habits as well as the stool calibers since the middle of summer. She underwent a colonoscopy and was found to have a-1.6-cm rectal mass lesion close to her internal sphincter. Subsequently she had a CT of her abdomen, pelvis, and chest done. Her CT studies showed no metastatic disease, but incidentally found to have a  mucocele of her appendix. An endo rectal ultrasound September 3, 2010 stages this lesion as a T2N1. She comes now for surgical management of this rectal cancer.
