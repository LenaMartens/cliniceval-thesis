Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectosigmoid colon, abdominal perineal resection:  Residual invasive moderately-well differentiated adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin is identified as multiple localized microscopic foci within the subepithelial stroma/submucosa, ranging in size from less than 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, adjacent to the grossly identified 2.3 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm treatment associated ulcer at the dentate line.  The adenocarcinoma focally undermines the overlying squamous mucosa and comes to within 1.1 cm of the distal margin.  The margins of resection, including the radial margin, are negative for malignancy.  Multiple (4) lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

AJCC, 7th ed, ypT1N0

B.  Precoccygeal fascia, biopsy:  Negative for malignancy.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 33.5 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 3.5 x 2.7 cm portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked.  A 2.3 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm ulcerative lesion is present within the anal canal, involving the dentate line, 2.1 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 3.1 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass appears to involve the perianal fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by KRAUS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""precoccygeal fascia"" is a 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm fragment of pink-tan fibroadipose tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by PETERSON.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Rectosigmoid colon, abdominal perineal resection:  Anal mucosa and rectal mucosa with intense inflammation and treatment associated changes.  Margins are negative.  No tumor identified. 

B.  Soft tissue, precoccygeal fascia, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.
