IMPRESSION
#1 Marked iron-deficiency anemia, intermittent red blood per rectum, tenderness and fullness in the left lower quadrant occurring over the last two years, very worrisome for a left-sided colon cancer
I cannot rule-out other pathology or even malabsorption as a cause of her iron-deficiency but this would not explain her bright-red blood per rectum or sensation of fullness with possible mesenteric nodes on the left lower quadrant.
#2 Marked iron-deficiency anemia with a hemoglobin of 4.8
#3 Hyperglycemia
PLAN
1.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
2.  Transfuse three units of blood.
3.  Following transfusion, we will proceed with a colonoscopy.  I have told her to take the bowel prep slowly over the course of all day Sunday.  She would like to avoid hospitalization if possible, and I think that is quite reasonable since her hemoglobin has been stable over the last few weeks.  If we do not have an answered after colonoscopy we will proceed with an EGD with small-bowel biopsy.  Further studies may be needed including a small-bowel capsule if we do not come up with a cause of her symptomatology in spite of the aforementioned plan.  I am very suspicious we are dealing with a left colonic lesion.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Mrs. Mann is self-referred for a low hemoglobin and weight-loss.

Mrs. Mann is a very pleasant 64-year-old woman retired elementary school teacher who has not felt well for four years.  She states that she has been bothered by lower abdominal cramping and periods of constipation.  By this, she states that for four to five days she will have trouble moving her bowels and will feel bloated and then will have normal stools for a period of three-to-four days.  Frequently, at the onset of stools she will also notice some fresh bright-red blood with occasional clots.  This was more so one-to-two years ago than it is now.  With this, over the last two-to-three years she has had progressive weight-loss from roughly 165 pounds down to her current weight of approximately 89 pounds.  She states her appetite is good.  She denies any nausea or vomiting.  She has not seen oil in her stools.  She is not known to have any pancreatic problem.  She finally sought medical attention approximately three weeks ago, and a hemoglobin was checked and was markedly low at 4.8% with an undetectable ferritin and an MCV of 58.  She states that she has no energy.  She denies any chest pain or significant shortness-of-breath.  She denies any presyncope or lightheadedness.  Her father had "colitis," and she believes in the 1970s she had one episode of passing mucus in her stool and her local physician questioned if she may have colitis.  This is not a chronic problem, however.  Paternal grandfather had colon cancer.  She states that at times when she is constipated she has a sensation of a lump in the back of her throat that has trouble starting a swallow but that she has never had any problems with dysphagia once food enters her chest, and when she is not constipated she denies any swallowing difficulties.  She believes that her skin tones have changed a bit where she feels jaundiced but her bilirubins have been normal.
