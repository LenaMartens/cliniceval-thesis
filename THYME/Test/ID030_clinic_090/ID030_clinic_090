#1 Stage IIIA colon cancer
I had a very long discussion with the patient about the need for adjuvant chemotherapy to decrease her risk of developing recurrent disease.  We talked about the standard regimen of modified FOLFOX, and we would recommend 12 cycles.  She will definitely need a port placed because of the infusion of 5-FU.  Patient would like to be treated closer to her hometown in Bison Cuero.  The closest oncologist there is Dr. Tiffany Gregg in New York.  I did call over to make the referral for her, but the closest appointment I could get was July 21, 2010.  Because the patient is exactly four weeks out from her surgery now, I would like for her to be started in less than six-weeks and within the next two-weeks.  Therefore, we will go ahead and set the patient up to have a port placed within the next week and then start chemotherapy shortly thereafter.  She will see me and be followed for her chemotherapy until she is able to transfer her care over to Dr. Tiffany Gregg in New York.  We went over the regimen as well as to expect the side-effects of FOLFOX, and the patient asked appropriate questions.  I did spend over 60 minutes with the patient, examining her, going over the plan of care, discussing the chemotherapy, the side-effects, as well as making the referral in the patient's presence.
The patient was seen and discussed with my staff, Dr. Leslie Hall.

This is a pleasant 61-year-old female from Bison Cuero, who was recently-diagnosed with stage III colon cancer.  Patient was in her usual state of health until May 2010 where on routine colonoscopy she was found to have a malignant polyp.  She underwent surgery by Dr. Leslie Mosley on June 3, 2010, when she had a laparoscopic subtotal colectomy and was found to have a-1.3-cm grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma with 4 out of 56 lymph nodes positive.  Further staging workup was completely negative.  Patient did well postoperatively, but on June 10, 2010, she was readmitted with a partial small-bowel obstruction which was just managed conservatively, and she was discharged on June 18, 2010.
Patient has completely recovered and is eating a normal diet and has maintained her weight.  She denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or any other symptom and is ready to proceed with further treatment.
