Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, abdominal colectomy:  A single hyperplastic polyp (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) is identified in the transverse colon. The appendix is not present. The proximal ileal and distal colonic margins are negative.  Multiple (8) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B.  Rectum and anus, proctectomy:  No residual adenocarcinoma; ulceration over a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm, located 5.0 cm from the anal mucosal margin.  There is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm tattooed area located 3.0 cm proximal to the ulcer bed.  The proximal rectal and distal anal margins are negative for tumor. Multiple (17) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C.  Soft tissue, puborectal muscle, biopsy:  Skeletal muscle; negative for tumor.
