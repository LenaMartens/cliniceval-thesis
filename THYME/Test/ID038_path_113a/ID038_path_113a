Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated, forming a 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm ill-defined fibrotic mass in the rectum.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Peritumoral fibrosis extends into the adjacent pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the radial resection margin.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and  tumor. Multiple (6 of 22) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma.  

B.  Colon, rectal margin, excision:  Colon with mild chronic colitis.  Negative for tumor.

C.  Colon, proximal rectal ring, excision:  Benign colonic tissue.

D.  Colon, distal rectal ring, excision: Benign colonic tissue.

E.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Cholesterolosis, otherwise without diagnostic abnormality.

F.  Liver, segments II, III, and IV, wedge resection:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary forming a 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm mass.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, by 0.5 cm.

G.  Liver, portion of segment V, wedge resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma forming a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm mass present at the surgical resection margin.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N2] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled rectum is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 20.5 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  The radial margin is inked.  A 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 0.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin and 1.5 cm from the radial margin, submitted perpendicularly.  Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  A diverticulum without sign of inflammation, 1.0 cm from the proximal margin, was identified.   Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DAILEY.

B.  Received fresh labeled rectum, new margin is an 8.5 x 6.0 x 2.5 cm portion of rectal mucosa without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by HARP.

C.  Received fresh labeled proximal rectal ring is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm fragment of mucosa with soft tissue without orientation.  All submitted. Grossed by HARP.

D.  Received fresh labeled distal rectal ring is a 2.8 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm fragment of mucosa with soft tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by HARP.

E.  Received fresh labeled gallbladder is a 10.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm gallbladder with a 0.3 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DAILEY.

F.  Received fresh labeled liver, segments II, III, and IV is a 270.0 gram, 16.0 x 9.8 x 4.0 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm tan mass is present 0.5 cm from the surgical margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HARP.

G.  Received fresh labeled liver, portion of segment V is a 45.0 gram, 7.2 x 6.2 x 2.5 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm tan mass is present at the surgical margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by GONZALEZ
