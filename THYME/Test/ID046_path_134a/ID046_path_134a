Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, upper rectum, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.8 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm sessile mass in the sigmoid colon.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (30) region lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  
With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable rectal mucosa identified.

C.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Mild chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis with a pigmented stone measuring 1.1 cm.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
