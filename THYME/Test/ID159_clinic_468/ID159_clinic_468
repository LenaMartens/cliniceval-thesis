LABORATORY
Reviewed available outside records including his April 8, 2008, operative note and his PET reports.  I have requested CT reports.  His films are all on QREADS.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Biopsy-proven recurrent/residual rectal cancer
Mr. Kraatz presents for an opinion regarding management of rectal cancer.  This was incompletely resected April 8, 2008, and now he is referred for consideration of surgical resection and intra-operative radiation therapy.  I discussed the factors that enter into this decision, and at this time we will restage the patient with a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis and PET scan, and this should be compared to his prior films which are on QREADS.  Patient will then meet with Dr. Sukey Orcutt from Colon and Rectal Surgery for a formal surgical visit.  Dr. Borrero will see him afterward for a radiation oncology perspective if he is surgically resectable.  Patient will also meet with Medical Oncology for chemotherapy recommendations.  If surgery is undertaken, then he will need to meet with Thrombophilia Clinic for discontinuation of his Coumadin in what will likely include heparin management.  He will also meet with Stomal Therapy given the peristomal irritation.  Discussed in detail with the patient and answered questions.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
An ECG will be checked in conjunction with his lab studies.  If the ECG is abnormal, he would require cardiology consultation prior to surgical resection.  However, we will hold off on ordering this pending Dr. Harvey evaluation.
Discussed with Dr. Ashley Haley, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at Hallberg Family Practice Community Hospital.

Mr. Kraatz is a delightful 57-year-old gentleman who is referred for evaluation and treatment of recurrent/residual rectal cancer.  Mr. Kraatz was initially diagnosed with a large rectal polyp on colonoscopy in 2000 performed for rectal pressure.  Transanal excision revealed a T1 cancer, and he reports having regular endoscopic ultrasound surveillance.  Information is unclear whether the cancer was in 2000 or in July 2002.
He was later found to have a recurrent cancer at the rectosigmoid junction on surveillance colonoscopy in 2007.  He received preoperative chemoradiation with 5-FU and Avastin, tolerated well, and completed November 2007.  He then underwent surgical resection April 8, 2008, with Hartmann's procedure and permanent colostomy placement.  His postoperative course was complicated by breathing problems and possibly sleep apnea.  He required intensive care initially for pulmonary monitoring.  Surgical APR was planned.  However, the tumor was fixed to the right pelvic inlet and sacrum and deemed surgically unresectably.  Given that the patient would not be surgically curable, perineal proctectomy was not performed.  He then received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and was discontinued after eight cycles due to neuropathy.  The patient then developed bleeding from the remaining Hartmann's stump in September 2009.  He was found to have biopsy-proven recurrence on colonoscopy February 11, 2010.  There were no synchronous lesions noted on full colonoscopy through the stoma.  PET scan February 19, 2010, showed uptake in the presacral soft-tissue, increased in size from 2.7 x 2.4-cm May 12, 2009, to 4.2 x 2.7-cm February 19, 2010.  Additionally, left hydronephrosis has developed likely from tumor-related obstruction.  A new 3.2 x 2.6-cm right abdominal mesenteric nodule developed consistent with metastatic disease, and there was moderate uptake in the right common iliac node.  There was punctate foci of FDG uptake in the liver with multiple new areas of uptake, but no corresponding lesion found on CT.  Micrometastasis cannot be excluded.  Mr. Kraatz then received more chemotherapy with Xeloda and Avastin.  He tolerated this fine until April 10 when he was found to have thrombosis from his port.  This required intensive care for TPA administration and heparin administration.  The Avastin was, therefore, stopped in the second week of April.  His port has been pulled since then, and he has had no further chemotherapy.  He presents now for restaging and further recommendations.
K-ras testing March 4, 2010, was negative.
From a symptom standpoint, Mr. Kraatz is asymptomatic.  He states he has intentionally tried to lose weight, and he has lost 25 pounds over the past month.  He has constant rectal bleeding, especially now that he is on Coumadin.  He denies any pain or any problems with constipation or diarrhea.  He notes a little bit of bleeding around the stoma site from irritation.
Mr. Kraatz's other systems complaints include occasional headache.  He had had nausea for a period of time, which resolved spontaneously two days ago.  He continues with neuropathy of the feet.  Upper extremity neuropathy has resolved.  He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, or shortness-of-breath.
Mr. Kraatz states he does not have sleep apnea as the testing has never confirmed this.  However, it sounds that the sleep study performed postoperatively was inconclusive, and a CPAP was advised.  He is morbidly obese and has tremendous difficulty managing hypertension, especially in the hospital setting.  Even outside of the hospital, he requires triple antihypertensive medication with clonidine, metoprolol, and quinapril.  He has never had a heart attack or a stroke, and there is normally no history of bleeding disorder or anesthesia reaction.  He is currently on Coumadin as previously stated for thrombosis from his chemotherapy port.  He does note that he reacts sensitively to medicines.  He is not using any narcotics for pain control currently.  There is a question of a CT allergy.  Mr. Kraatz states this is an allergy to Contratest years ago which precipitated an asthma attack.  He has had seven or eight contrast CTs since then with no reaction, per patient report.  I have requested these radiology reports.  Other comorbidities include asthma, but he does not use any inhalers.  He takes TriCor for hypertriglyceridemia.
