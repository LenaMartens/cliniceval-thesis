Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated forming a 4.6 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm mass located 0.3 cm from the dentate line and 1.7 cm from the anal skin margin.  Tumor invades into (but not through )the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  No lymphovascular invasion identified.  Multiple (26) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.    For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in LWHH BhzgAkbn. 

B.  Appendix, appendectomy:  Mucinous cystadenoma with low to moderate dysplasia, confined to the lumen with focal involvement of the proximal margin. 

With available surgical material, [AJCCpT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
