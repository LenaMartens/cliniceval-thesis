A.  Colon, left, resection:  Invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.8 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm ulcerative and polypoid mass in the left colon, 9.3 cm from the nearest mucosal margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Focus suspicious for lymphatic/vascular invasion.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (35) diverticula are also identified.  Multiple ( 21 ) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
