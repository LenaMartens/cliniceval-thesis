Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.8 x 3.6 x 1.0 cm ulcerated mass in the cecum, 4.7 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A hyperplastic polyp (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm) is also identified in the ascending colon.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the lumen.  Multiple (5 of 43) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma with extranodal extension present (2.2 cm size of largest metastasis).  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2a] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 17.3 cm of terminal ileum, 43.4 cm of cecum and ascending colon, and a 15.8 x 0.4 cm appendix.  A 3.8 x 3.6 x 1.0 cm ulcerated mass is present within the cecum, 4.7 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends into pericolonic fat.  The mass is 38.0 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  There is also a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm polyp in the ascending colon located 10.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Multiple (46) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BALDWIN.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jay Blanton, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon tissue (block A3).  Upon completion, results will be available in OQOE RqvtJpzg.
