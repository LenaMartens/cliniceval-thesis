Dr. English is an 83-year-old gentleman referred by Cleta Lefebre with obstructing transverse colon carcinoma as well as a bladder cancer.  Dr. English has had an episode of colonic obstruction which he said lasted for approximately nine days a few weeks ago and has a mass in the transverse colon which has been biopsied but has not yet been proven as adenocarcinoma.  Nevertheless with this history and the findings on colonoscopy, I have discussed transverse colon resection with the risk and results in detail.   We should proceed as soon as possible, and this will be scheduled for Monday.  He also has a bladder tumor and has been seen by Dr. Francis Banks, and we have agreed that this can be done at a later date as an outpatient procedure.
