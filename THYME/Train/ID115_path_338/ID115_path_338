Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon and rectum, abdominal perineal resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (1.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm) located in the rectum, at the dentate line.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the perirectal adventia.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not identified.  The tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the radial resection margin, and the proximal and distal margins are widely free.  Multiple (16) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
