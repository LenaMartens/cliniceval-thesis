#1 Colon cancer at hepatic flexure (high-grade dysplasia)

[end section id="20102"]

Mr. King is a 68-year-old gentleman who has a cancer (adenomatous polyps) in the hepatic flexure of colon, some with high-grade dysplasia. Patient began having colonoscopies in 2008.  A 3-cm tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia was found and has been worked on in 2008, again in January of 2009, which biopsy from previous polypectomy site showed normal colon, and two diminutive polyps were also removed, pathology showing tubulovillous adenoma.  His last colonoscopy was December 23, 2009, and again the cecal area was negative for dysplasia or malignancy.  There were two new 3 to 5-mm polyps found in the ascending colon, which were removed, and another 10-mm sessile polyp in the hepatic flexure, which was partially removed.  That pathology came back tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. He obtained a preoperative CT-scan which was negative.  There is no evidence of metastasis.
