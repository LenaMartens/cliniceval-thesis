#1 Colon cancer, near obstructing
Patient plans to proceed with a hand-assisted laparoscopic left hemicolectomy.  I discussed with him and his family the nature of the surgery and the indication.  The risk of the anastomosis was the primary risk discussed including the possibility of an anastomotic leak, need for intervention, possibly even surgery and a temporary stoma.  We also discussed the fact that we may not be able to do this laparoscopically, and he may require a large incision.  Other risks included the possible need for a blood transfusion which the patient is willing to accept.  The risk of exacerbating his stroke was also discussed.  We also discussed the risk of wound infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.  A risk of an acute cardiopulmonary event was discussed, and the patient wishes to be resuscitated.  After all these risks were discussed, the general course of the operation and expected outcomes were discussed.  The patient was marked.  The consent form was obtained.  He was listed for surgery.

Mr. Higginbotham is a 75-year-old gentleman here for a splenic flexure colon cancer.

This is a gentleman who otherwise was in good health and underwent a screening colonoscopy (his first one) just at the end of the year.  At that time he was found to have a large, near-obstructing distal transverse colon mass which was biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma.  He was undergoing evaluation for this and for possible surgery at Newark when he experienced a stroke.  He was admitted to MVMC.  Extensive work-up for the stroke was non-definitive as far as causes, and he has regained 90% of his function and was cleared for surgery by our neurology colleagues.  He is basically on an aspirin and has been doing well with that regimen.  Given the fact that he has a large mass which is near obstructing, it was recommended that he undergo surgery when the Neurology Service felt that he would be appropriate, understanding the risks of a stroke within the past month may be exacerbated by a general anesthetic.  The patient has never had an abdominal surgery.  Prior to the stroke he was walking without difficulty.  Now he uses a walker for some support, but he is otherwise a very vigorous gentleman.
