Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, right, resection:  Microscopic focus (<0.1 cm) of residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, arising in an area of induration.  The residual tumor is present within the deep bundles of the muscularis propria.  Lymphovascular invasion is absent.  The radial resection margin is negative for tumor by 0.8 cm.  The mucosal resection margins are negative for  tumor.  Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

B.  Colon, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Gross examination only.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled rectum is a low anterior resection specimen with anastomosis consisting of 13.9 cm in length portion of rectum.  The radial margin is inked.  A 1.5 x 1.5 cm scar-like induration is present within the rectum at the anastomotic site, 6.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin, 7.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin, and 1.0 cm from the radial margin. Grossly, the scar is confined to the mucosa.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ARRINGTON.

B.  Received fresh labeled colon, proximal anastomotic ring is a 2.0 x 1.1 cm fragment of grossly unremarkable pink-tan, glistening annular bowel.  No masses are identified.  Grossed by ARRINGTON.

C.  Received fresh labeled rectum, distal anastomotic ring is a 1.9 x 0.8 cm fragment of pink-tan grossly unremarkable pink-tan, glistening annular bowel.  No masses are identified.  Grossed by PHILLIPS
