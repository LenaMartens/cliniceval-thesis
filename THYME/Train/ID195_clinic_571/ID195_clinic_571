#1 Recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the descending colon
This diagnosis is based on a colonoscopy performed at an outside hospital with the pathology slides being read here.  The colonoscopy report that Mr. Savage brings with him is not extremely detailed, and the pathology from the biopsy during the EGD is not clear of whether this is from the cardia or from above the GE junction.  After discussion with Dr. Ostrander, we thought it would be prudent for the colonoscopy and EGD to be repeated.  The colonoscopy will provide us with details of the exact location and size of polyps and masses, and repeat biopsies can be performed.  A repeat EGD can be done to confirm the presence or absence of Barrett's esophagus.
Mr. Savage has had a number of tests performed here at Gothenburg Dental Hospital which includes a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis which demonstrates a circumferential wall thickening of the distal sigmoid colon which should represent the recently discovered colon carcinoma.  There was no CT evidence of metastatic disease.  A chest x-ray was performed on the 20th of July which demonstrated borderline cardiomegaly, and the chest was otherwise negative.
Mr. Savage is currently on Warfarin therapy, and our plan is for him to come off his Warfarin, for him to have his colonoscopy and EGD with biopsies and then to be seen by a colorectal surgeon the next day after remaining on clear liquids after his procedures and then to have surgery planned for the following day and therefore he will remain with a suitable INR during that period.
#2 Preoperative assessment
This is currently being completed by Dr. Olson from Wisconsin, and a PET myocardial perfusion scan is being performed, which does show an ejection fraction of 33% with a large fixed defect consistent with infarction involving apical, anterior, and anteroseptal segments and severe left ventricular enlargement.  Also, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response on an ECG on the 20th of July, and subsequently his rate-controlling medications have been adjusted.
Overnight oximetry was performed on the 20th of July 2010, and demonstrates 127 drops in saturation of at least 4% with a very abnormal baseline suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea.  It was felt that Mr. Savage should be evaluated in Saint Catherine Health Center for the possibility of an overnight sleep study and prior to any surgery.
Once these tests and consults have been completed, we will see Mr. Savage at the time of his consult with the colorectal surgeon.

Mr. Savage is a very pleasant 63-year-old gentleman who comes to the clinic today accompanied by his wife.  He resides in Norcross and states that his symptoms of constipation and rectal bleeding began in March 2010.  He has been noticing occasional bright-red blood per rectum which occurs for three-to-four days before subsiding and also has noticed on occasions very dark stool but denies that this is black.  He has also noticed constipation, which is a change in bowel habit for him.  These symptoms have remained stable up til now, and with no other associated symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or dysphagia.  His weight has increased, and his appetite has remained good.  He has developed some reflux symptoms and symptoms of bloating, and he had an EGD and colonoscopy performed per his local care provider on the 1st of July 2010.
His colonoscopy report that he brings with him demonstrates a sessile polyps seen in the descending colon; a pedunculated polyp was also seen; and an ulcerated mass was found.  Multiple biopsies were sent to pathology.  Two polyps were also seen in the rectum.  Further details of the precise nature and location of these lesions are not available within the report.  The specimens have been reviewed by the pathologists here at Gothenburg Dental Hospital and demonstrate that two polyps in the rectum were found to be hyperplastic, a biopsy in the colon at 20 cm was invasive grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma, and a biopsy of the colon at 50 cm was a hyperplastic polyp.
Mr. Savage also underwent an EGD performed on the 1st of July 2010 which demonstrated a sliding hiatal hernia, and an irregular GE junction was noted.  The report states that multiple biopsies were obtained and sent to pathology.  The review of the pathology specimens here of the GE during the upper endoscopy demonstrates small foci of intestinal metaplasia in gastroesophageal junction-type mucosa with mild chronic inflammation.  This could represent either specialized Barrett's mucosa if truly taken above the GE junction or focal intestinal metaplasia of the gastric cardia.  There is no dysplasia.
Mr. Savage has been seen by Dr. Olson in the Division of General Internal Medicine where she has organized a very extensive workup for his comorbidities.  Mr. Savage's comorbidities include cardiomyopathy with a myocardial infarction in 2003 with subsequent coronary stenting.  He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and an EF of approximately 33% for which he is on Warfarin therapy.  In November 2008, he had a CT-scan performed which was suggestive of possible pulmonary emboli, but this has not been confirmed.  He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and has been labeled with COPD in the past after having been a smoker for 43 years at 1-1/2 packs a day and having stopped in 2003.  He is obese with a history suggestive of sleep apnea.
