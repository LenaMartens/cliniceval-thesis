Reviewed outside colonoscopy report.
IMPRESSION
#1 Distal rectal mass
Mr. Morse is referred for further treatment of a distal rectal mass.  I discussed possible options with him both endoscopic and surgical, and given the nature of the lesion we would advise proceeding with a CT-scan and endoscopic ultrasound, after which patient will meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery for consideration of transanal excision, as given the distal location I believe endoscopic maneuvers will be difficult to remove the lesion and the size may be prohibitive.  I would request further biopsies to exclude malignancy.  MoviPrep prescription was provided to the patient, and I will meet with him again prior to the surgeon visit.   We requested slides.
#2 Vasovagal episode
Mr. Morse sustained a vasovagal episode while in our office.  He and his sister have both had these and they state this is their "normal" reaction during doctor visits.  He has had no problems with his colonoscopy or other previous physician visits other than an ophthalmology appointment.   After review with Dr. Rodriguez we will obtain ECG and send to cardiology for investigation.  I also reviewed Lynch syndrome with him.
Discussed with Dr. Jamie Rodriguez.  Note to follow.

Distal rectal mass.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Morse is a 56-year-old gentleman who presents for treatment of a rectal mass.  Mr. Morse underwent his first colonoscopy February 4, 2010, for screening purposes. A 4-cm mass was noted in the distal rectum with biopsies positive for villous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  This is described as a sessile, large, flat, distal rectal polyp.  Cold biopsies only were obtained to allow for further treatment.  No cancer staging has been performed, and Mr. Morse is asymptomatic with no hematochezia, melena, changes to bowel habit or narrowed stool caliber.  His family history is involved by a sister with colon polyps at age 53.
Comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia for which he uses medications.  He has no history of chest pains, chest pressures, shortness-of-breath, thrombosis or glaucoma.  He does not smoke and has no medication allergies.  He does; however, have a history of syncopal episodes historically occurring ten years ago in the ophthalmologist's office.  This episode is described as feeling lightheaded and blacking out for a couple of seconds.  There is no accompanying chest pains or heart palpitations.
During the course of our visit when standing up, Mr. Morse developed another syncopal episode, his second such episode.  As before, he described feeling lightheaded, he lost consciousness for approximately two seconds, and then came to.  He sustained no head trauma and was guided to the floor for examination.  His heart rate remained stable, and his blood pressure was stable at 110/70, although he was feeling back to normal when this was obtained.  He developed diaphoresis.  There was no evidence of seizures or other neurological complaints.  The episode was very short-lived, and the patient was conversant throughout.

The skin cancer scar is well-healed with no signs of recurrence.Vessels:  No carotic bruits.Rectum:  Normal perianal exam.  The digital exam is positive for a large 3- to 4-cm mass in the distal rectum.  Approximately 1-cm in the anal verge posteriorly.  I am able to appreciate the superior aspect of the lesion; however, it is firmer than I would suspect for a villous adenoma.
