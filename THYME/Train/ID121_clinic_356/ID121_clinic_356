#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T2, N1, (1 of 13) M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Jane Burdett's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Clifford Thompson, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
I have made follow-up arrangements for Mr. Mcgee to return in the outpatient setting to have formal treatment evaluation.  I will coordinate appointment with Dr. Burdett, Dr. Smith, as well as Dr. Thompson.  This appointment will include a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, and comprehensive laboratory panel.  He has verbalized understanding and does wish to return for formal treatment evaluation but will probably pursue treatment locally.  I have emphasized to him that he needs to make contact with a local medical oncologist to help insure continuity of care which he plans on doing.

I have been asked to visit with Mr. Mcgee for postoperative education purposes.   Briefly, he is very pleasant 47 year-old male from Paris, Michigan.
1.  December 2009 - Presented locally with complaints of fatigue.  Local medical physician noted to have low ferritin level.
2.  December 30, 2009 - Colonoscopy performed locally identifying a rectal mass 5-cm from the anal verge.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  January 14, 2010 - Endorectal ultrasound performed staging the tumor at T2, M0, with no evidence of perirectal adenopathy.
4.  February 4, 2010 - Referred to Woodridge Community Health Center.  Underwent CT-scan showing mildly prominent left periaortic lymph node as well as lymph node between the left renal vein mildly prominent, no evidence of distant metastasis.
5.  February 4, 2010 - Colonoscopy performed at Woodridge Community Health Center showing a 2.5-cm mass at the distal rectum staged at T2/T3, N0.  CEA 0.4.
6.  February 10, 2010 - Evaluated by Dr. Sandy Thompson of Medical Oncology, Dr. Chris Smith of Radiation Oncology, as well as Dr. Burdett of Colon and Rectal Surgery.  Joint consensus to have the patient proceed with direct surgical intervention as no definitive proof that tumor beyond T2/T3 with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.
7.  February 25, 2010 - Underwent low-anterior resection by Dr. Burdett.  Per operative note, no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology showing a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 2.1 x 1.9 x 0.6-cm mass in the rectum.  The tumor invaded into but not through the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic and vascular invasion was present.  The tumor extended to within one cm of the distal margin but able to be removed completely.  One of 13 regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease.  Staged at T2, N1, M0.
Mr. Mcgee is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
