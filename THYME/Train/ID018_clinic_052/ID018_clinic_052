Patient has multiple medical problems including low ejection fraction who has bled down to a hemoglobin of 5, thus leading to respiratory failure, pneumonia, congestive failure, and has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.  He also has gastric ulcer.  Has a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the cecum.  Needs removal.  Discussed, therefore, risks, goals, alternatives, benefits, team approach to surgical care, risk of blood transfusion, chance of blood transfusion, chance of postoperative stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure, MI, etc., with patient and family who agree to proceed with attempted hand-assisted laparoscopic right hemicolectomy but more likely open due to body habitus and previous cholecystectomy scar tomorrow.  Admit tonight for careful hydration and establishment of accurate hemoglobin, bowel prep, and any other preoperative management as necessary.  Will need ICU postop.  All questions answered.  Marked.  Consented.  Bowel prep given and explained as the patient will be admitted.  Listed for tomorrow.
Discussed with Mr. Wilson.
