#1 Functional status
Mr. Schwartz is actually dependent on activities of daily living.  He has multiple reasons for gait imbalance--one being musculoskeletal weakness, second is severe osteoarthritis especially of the left hip, the third one being peripheral neuropathy secondary to vincristine, fourth being probably medication side-effects.  He needs Easy Lift to stand up, and he had an episode of upper respiratory tract infection on July 28 after which he has deteriorated more but has been perking up a little bit.
#2 Ascending colon cancer
In February 2010 he was complaining of dizziness and weakness.  Hemoglobin was 8.7 from a previous value of 14.  Colonoscopy revealed a malignant-appearing mucosal mass at the hepatic flexure of the colon, and it was grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  No metastasis.  He was operated on April 24.  Postoperatively he remains asymptomatic now, and the latest hemoglobin 10.5 on July 29.
#3 Anemia
Secondary to GI bleed, secondary to adenocarcinoma of the colon.  Now hemoglobin is 10.5.
#4 Possible TIA
Two occasions in April, on  April 7 and April 15, there was a question of possible stroke/TIA where he was not able to move is left arm and leg and was unresponsive.  It went away in ten minutes spontaneously.  The same episode happened on April 15 when he was unable to raise his left arm and had difficulties maneuvering his wheelchair.  No deficits on neurological examination.  He is currently on anticoagulant and also on aspirin.  Hemoglobin on July 29 is 10.5.
#5 Hypertension
Long-standing history of hypertension which is well-controlled with the latest being 130/74, pulse rate of 76.
#6 BPH
He has history of BPH and was on Cardura before which was discontinued because of orthostatic hypotension.  He is on Proscar 5-mg daily.
#7 Atrial fibrillation
He is currently maintained on Coumadin for anticoagulation.  Recent INR is 2.2 on August 6 (yesterday).
#8 History of left lower-extremity DVT with protein S deficiency
#9 Peripheral neuropathy secondary to vincristine
He is maintained on Neurontin three times a day.
#10 Depression
Stable on Celexa 20-mg daily.  The last time the dose was increased was in February 2010.
PLAN
Continue physical therapy, occupational therapy for musculoskeletal strengthening and neuromuscular coordination as permitted.  Will plan to try to discontinued oxycodone which could be one of the causes for gait instability and to prevent falls.  He is dependent on activities of daily living and probably would be a lifelong term resident of the nursing home.
