#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Martin is a 69-year-old male who states he had rectal bleeding through the winter months.  This led to a colonoscopy on 21 April 2010 which showed a rectal mass.  Biopsies read here show invasive grade 2 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Rest of colonoscopy to the cecum was normal.  Has a past history of a tubular adenoma removed at 30 cm in 2008 also done elsewhere.  He also went to Pearl River Center and now with no testing done has decided to come to Young Mens Christian Association County Chiropractic Center.
