DATA
Reviewed the outside CT-scan which looks of reasonable quality.  There is a low-density lesion really peripherally in the right lobe of the liver.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
#1 A metachronous colon cancer
#2 History of cecal cancer post right hemicolectomy
This is very suspicious for a syndromic colon cancer, specifically HNPCC or Lynch syndrome.  He has no children at-risk and has single sibling who is already under screening and surveillance.  I do not think genetic testing would add anything, and it was likely previously negative at the Lawrence Health Center.  However, this does not exclude the possibility of an inherited predisposition.
In any event, this is his third primary colon cancer including a 5-mm cancer.  I think he needs a subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.  I reviewed with Dr. Lewis, he agrees.
For preanesthetic review, I am going to get pulmonary function tests to see what his reactive airway status is.
No need for further diagnostic tests.  We will ask for a formal review of the CT.  Dr. Mcmahon was consulted, and he can handle the lesion intraoperatively.  He will see the patient Wednesday with Dr. Lewis.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, but would like additional information. Advance Directive information packet provided to the patient. NR2304-99, DX7281-51, KN2871-76, PO1767-20.

Management of recurrent "colon cancer."

#1 Multifocal colon cancer
Mr. Thomason is a 54-year-old man who approximately four and a-half years ago had a cecal cancer.  This is detected on a screening examination.  He underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy at the Lawrence Health Center.  He has a family history of colon cancer with his maternal grandfather dying at age 37 of colon cancer.  By his recollection, there was some type of genetic testing that was done, but he was given the "all clear."  He had a follow-up colonoscopy one-year later that was normal.  He just recently presented for a three-year surveillance examination and was found to have a 50% obstructing mass in the transverse colon but not at the anastomosis.  More concerning is the finding of a 5-mm polyp 10-cm distal to this.  This also showed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma in a 5-mm polyp.  These have been reviewed here.
He is currently asymptomatic.  He has no systemic symptoms.  He comes here for a second opinion regarding management.  He does smoke cigarettes.
