**Medical student note**
Mrs. Dunbar is an 85-year-old woman from San Jose, California who has sought care at SGSHH multiple times in the past.  She presented for evaluation of a right lower quadrant mass and had an open right hemicolectomy on 10/18/10 with excision of invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum.
#1 Invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum, negative lymph nodes, s/p open right hemicolectomy on 10/18/10
#2 History of percutaneous biliary catheter
She appears to be progressing well in the post-operative course.  She has some RLQ abdominal pain on exam today but no other signs or symptoms of infection.  She has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Rose on 11/2/10.  There are no sutures to be removed.  The cancer invaded into the pericolic fat but the cecal and ileal margins were negative.  No oncologic follow-up is planned at this time.  Given her history of the hepatic abscess and percutaneous biliary catheter, we will keep watch for signs and symptoms of infection that are hepatobiliary in nature as well and continue her chronic cephalosporin prophylaxis.
#3 Coccygeal pressure ulcer, stage 2
This was noted during her pre-operative clinic appointments and appears to have improved from being purple and non-blanching to red and blanching.  There is no clear evidence of candidal infection on exam.  We will plan to reposition her every 30-minutes, control elevation of the head of the bed and to have our staff check the wound during dressing changes that are currently scheduled for every 3 days.  Continue Nystatin powder.  She would also benefit from a nutritional assessment.
#4  Acute kidney injury
Her baseline creatinine is 0.8 and reached a high of 2.4 on 10/22/10.  BUN/Cr ratio was not > 20.  This is likely acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypoperfusion of the kidneys during the extensive surgery or in the post-operative period during fluid shifts.  We do not have a UA for further clarification of this.  She also appears to have mild dehydration on exam.  We will encourage oral fluid intake and recheck electrolytes tomorrow.  We may need to hold her diuretic and/or angiotensin receptor blocker if continued improvement in creatinine is not noted.
#5 Diabetes mellitus
Her HbA1c was recently measured at 10.  According to the medical record, she had been on prednisone 10-mg BID from July to early October, so corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia as well as inflammatory response to the colon cancer likely contributed to recent hyperglycemia.  She sees Ophthalmology regularly with no evidence of diabetes-related retinal disease.  She was maintained on NPH and SSI using Aspart in the hospital with RMGs from 128-183 during the last days of her hospitalization.  We have clarified a recommended regimen from DCS which we will follow with clinician review of RMGs twice-weekly.  Insulin regimen: NPH 8 units every morning, SSI with Aspart administered after patient has finished at least 50% of each meal to avoid hypoglycemia.
#6 Bowel care
She has been passing gas and the hospital record notes several bowel movements.  We will continue her on Colace once-daily and avoid constipation considering the nature of her surgery.  We will continue her on a soft diet with no raw fruits or vegetables.
#7 Hypertension
Continue Benicar, Dyazide and nitroglycerin patch presently.  She appears to use furosemide PRN at-home which we will not provide currently.  We may decrease or stop the ARB and/or diuretics if her renal function does not improve.
#8 Deconditioning
She will be assessed for physical therapy shortly and participation in physical therapy will be a critical component of her resuming independence with ADLs.  She is able to stand and to walk with the use of a walker currently.  She is on multiple medications that put her at-risk for falls.
#9 Chest pain syndrome
She was seen by Cardiology pre-operatively.  She has multiple normal rest ECGs and her last echocardiogram in 2002 was normal.  It appears her chest pain has a vasospastic component.  We will continue to use the nitroglycerine patch and have SL tabs available PRN.
#10 Chronic LE edema
Continue diuretics (see #3 and 7) and compression stockings
#11 Prophylaxis
Compression stockings, encourage ambulation.
#12 Code status
The patient is full code.
#13 Disposition
Mrs. Dunbar was living independently at-home prior to surgery and should make a full recovery to that level of function.  Anticipated stay is < 30 days.

Mrs. Dunbar is an 85-year-old woman from San Jose, California who has sought care at SGSHH multiple times in the past.  She presented for evaluation of a right lower quadrant mass and had an open right hemicolectomy on 10/18/10 with excision of invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum.
#1 Invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum, negative lymph nodes, s/p open right hemicolectomy on 10/18/10
Mrs. Dunbar presented for evaluation with RUQ and right flank pain, decreased appetite and weight-loss and a CT demonstrating a right lower quadrant right flank mass that could not be differentiated from the cecum.  Surgery included removal of a small portion of distal ileum.  She tolerated the procedure well and post-operative course was complicated by ileus requiring placement of an NG tube and acute kidney injury.  Her baseline creatinine is 0.8 and peaked at 2.4 on 10/22/10.  BUN high was 31.  There was no UA performed in the post-operative period.  She was receiving about 1.6L IV fluids daily in the days prior to the creatinine peak.  She does not recall having a bowel movement post-operatively (she does recall passing gas).  Multiple bowel movements are charted.  She was noted to be deconditioned following the surgery and transferred to LGCH for continuing rehabilitation with the plan of returning to independent living alone at her home in San Jose, California.  Presently she is feeling okay, noting that she has abdominal pain most prominent in the RLQ.  She is disappointed that her daughter has taken all her clothes home with her to the Saint John, Washington during the hospitalization so that here at LGCH she has only one outfit in which to dress for meals and ambulation.  She is also missing her husband who died five years ago.
#2 Coccygeal pressure ulcer, stage 2
This was noted to be present at her outpatient clinic appointments prior to the surgery and hospitalization.  It appears to have improved from purple and non-blanchable to red and blanchable.  A candidal-appearing perineal infection was also noted.  She received wound care while hospitalized and comes with recommendations for wound care including Nystatin powder, dressing changes, repositioning, limited head of bed elevation and a Roho cushion.
