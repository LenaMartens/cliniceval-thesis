#1 Locally advanced T4 tumor with no evidence of metastatic disease in the liver
Given her physical exam and current state, I think it is reasonable to proceed with a colonoscopy to clear the rest of the colon.  We also will get tissue for microsatellite instability testing.  The patient will certainly need a combined procedure for a duodenal resection.  She might very well need a Whipple as well as a colectomy.  I will be transferring her to my service at Genesis Senior Living Hospital And Medical Center.  I will have Dr. Dyal visit with her, and we will schedule.  If her hemoglobin remains stable, then I would even consider starting to feed her and then possibly arranging this in the next week or so as an outpatient.
This is discussed with the patient.  Card was given.  All questions were answered.  Will transfer to New England Care Physicians Center.

I was asked by Dr. Barrington to visit with Mrs. Ramos in regard to her newly-diagnosed colonic mass.  Mrs. Ramos is a 49-year-old woman who was transferred in emergently for question of a bleeding gastric ulcer.  She was seen at an outside hospital with a hemoglobin of 5 and underwent an upper endoscopy after she had been complaining of four days of nausea, emesis, and diarrhea.  Endoscopy showed a large ulceration in the duodenum, the question whether or not it was bleeding.  Given this, she was transferred emergently to the Roc Neck Health Institute at Fort Logan for evaluation.  She was found to be stable at the time.  She was resuscitated with blood, placed in the ICU.  Further evaluation was performed, which included a CT-scan, which showed a large mass in the hepatic flexure with involvement of the duodenum and with a clear fistulous communication between the two.  On detailed history, the patient has over the last few months progressively gotten weaker but has been able to function until basically last week when she started having diarrhea and nausea and upper abdominal discomfort.  The patient has no family history of colon cancer, has had no other history worrisome for a familial syndrome.  She has had no surgeries in the past.
