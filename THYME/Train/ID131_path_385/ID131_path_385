Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, pre-sacral mass, excision:  Benign fibroadipose tissue with fibrosis and non-specific chronic inflammation.  Negative for tumor.

B.  Soft tissue, left pelvic floor tumor, biopsy:  Involved by moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.

C.  Soft tissue, left additional pelvic floor tissue, biopsy:  Involved by moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.

D.  Soft tissue, left lateral margin pelvic floor, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

E.  Soft tissue, left posterior margin pelvic floor, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""left pelvic floor tumor"" is a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm portion of pink-tan soft tissue with a 1.1 x 1.0 cm area of mucin on the surface.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DIGIROLAMO.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""left additional pelvic floor tissue"" are three fragments of red-yellow soft tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.9 x 2.4 cm in aggregate.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by JOHNSON.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""left lateral margin pelvic floor"" is a 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm aggregate of yellow-red soft tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted.  Grossed by JOHNSON.
