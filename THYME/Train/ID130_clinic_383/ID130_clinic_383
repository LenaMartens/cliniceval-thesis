#1 Status-post hand-assisted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy
I rediscussed with her continuing to use the Hibiclens soap daily until the incision completely heals, and we gave her some packets of this.  I also talked to her about using some milk of magnesia 30 cc once to twice-daily with a big 8-ounce glass of water to help her pass a bowel movement.  I discussed with her continuing on the soft diet for the next three-to-four weeks, and then she may start introducing regular foods back into her diet.  We discussed signs and symptoms of infection and when to call her primary doctor if she notices these or to call our service if she notices these.  I discussed with her the lifting restriction--nothing over 10 pounds for the next six to eight weeks.  I also discussed with her that we would be sending her a follow-up appointment for Dr. Bernard and Oncology for the next four weeks to follow-up here.  I did tell her to plan on following-up with the local oncologist at-home.  That is where she is planning to get her chemotherapy, et cetera, if needed.  I said that appointment should be made within also the next month.  If she chooses just to see the oncologist closer to home that that would be fine.  She would just need to give us a call, and I would cancel her appointments here but also make sure that she had that appointment and then follow-up with how her incision and postsurgical course is going.  She understood this.  She is going to think about whether or not she is going to follow-up here or not for her oncology appointment.  I discussed with her that it is very important that she does follow-up with an oncologist in the next four weeks whether it is here or closer to home.  She understood that as well.  I also set her up to get a Fragmin injection today at the Arizona State Clinic.  She had no other questions or concerns at this point in time.

Mrs. Sternberg is a 43-year-old female who was recently-diagnosed with a rectosigmoid carcinoma, and she had surgery on February 25, 2010, by Dr. Bernard for a hand-assisted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy.  She states since leaving the hospital she has been doing really well.  She has been able to eat a soft diet with no troubles with nauseousness or vomiting.  She continues to pass gas; however, she has not had a bowel movement at this point in time.  She is urinating okay.  She says her pain continues to improve.  Her incision has continued to look good.  She did not use a Hibiclens soap because she was not sent home with any, but we discussed this as well.  She has been otherwise feeling well, and she did not have any complaints.
