Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Moderately grade 3 (of 4), mucinous adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.6 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm mass in the anorectal junction, arising in a background of villiform low-grade dysplasia and mild to moderately active chronic colitis.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria focally into the perirectal adipose tissue.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Background mucosa shows mild active chronic colitis.  Multiple (84) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).

Seen with Dr. Jackie Davis.

B.  Colon, redundant sigmoid, resection:  Segment of colon with superficial mucosal erosion (1.3 x 0.5 cm).

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in JBGF JrqyNhra.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""anus, rectum,"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 31.2 cm in length portion of rectum and anus.  A 2.6 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm mucinous mass involving a skin tag (with prior biopsy site changes) is present involving the rectum and anus, 1.2 cm from the anal skin margin, and 1.8 cm from the radial margin.  There is an additional adjacent skin tag (1.5 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm) in the anus.  In the rectum, 1.0 cm proximal to the tumor is a 5.0 x 2.2 cm area of ulceration.  The more proximal portion of resected rectum also shows areas of ulceration.  Multiple (85) lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BURLESON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""redundant sigmoid colon"" is a 13.3 cm segment of colon with a 1.3 x 0.5 cm ulcer located 2.2 cm from the closest surgical resection margin.  A portion of the mucosa is dusky.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BURLESON.
