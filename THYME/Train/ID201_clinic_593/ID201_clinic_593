#1 Resected grade 4/4 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, clinical stage T4, NX, M0
At the time of this dictation the final pathology report on the surgical specimen was still not available.  Mr. Como underwent induction chemotherapy and radiation for rectal cancer and is status-post resection.  I met with the patient and family members to discuss additional treatment options.  It is my recommendation for Mr. Como to be seen by his local oncologist in Great Mills in about four weeks from now to discuss additional chemotherapy (FOLFOX).  I briefly discussed with the patient that it is our recommendation for him to undergo four months of chemotherapy with a FOLFOX-based regimen.  Briefly discussed with the patient some of the side-effects associated with the use of chemotherapy in this setting.  Patient is to have a more detailed conversation regarding additional side-effects of the chemotherapy with his local oncologist.  I offered the patient the possibility of coming to El Monte Clinic for that follow-up.
Later...results of pathology shows 3 lymph nodes with tumor invasion and significant treatment effects. IHC for hMLH is negative for all markers. These results were communicated to the patient and family members.

Adenocarcinoma of the rectum.

Patient is being seen at the request of Dr. Pedro Frandsen because of his adenocarcinoma of the rectum status-post surgery.
Mr. Como is a delightful 19-year-old male who is here at the clinic recovering from surgery for a rectal cancer.  The patient reports having a history of rectal bleeding associated with abdominal pain that stayed for several months.  On April 1, 2010, the patient underwent a colonoscopy that demonstrated a mass in the rectal area.  Pathology has been reviewed here at the El Monte Clinic, and in fact, confirmed the presence of a grade 4/4 adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Como was then seen by Medical as well as Radiation Oncology and received concurrent treatments with radiation (5040 cGy to the colorectal area in 28 fractions over 38 days) with concurrent 5-FU.
On August 4, 2010, the patient presented to the El Monte Clinic and was seen initially by Gastroenterology.  He then underwent an additional workup that included a PET scan (August 10, 2010).  The PET scan demonstrated diffuse rectal thickening with persistent but somehow less FDG uptake compared to the outside examination.  Activity appears confined to the inner margins of the lesion on the current study.  A left external iliac lymph node and a right external iliac lymph node were seen on this scan showing a similar pattern of calcification, which was not seen on the prior exam.  This was suggestive of having metastatic involvement.  In addition to this, there was some perirectal soft tissues that were also concerning for having metastasis.
On August 12, 2010, the patient was taken to the OR and underwent cystoscopy, placement of retrograde stents, pelvic exenteration with en bloc resection of the rectum, sigmoid, anus, prostate, bladder, seminal vesicles, vas deferens, distal ureters, as well as creation of a colostomy.  In addition, the patient underwent lymphadenectomy of the right external iliac area, lymphadenectomy of the left external iliac as well as left internal iliac area.  In addition to all of these procedures, the patient had an exploratory laparotomy, radical cystoprostatectomy as en bloc excision with the rectum, ileal conduit urinary diversion, intraoperative radiation therapy, as well as right inferiorly based pedicle omentum coverage of the irradiated pelvis.
Medical Oncology was then consulted to discuss additional treatment options.
