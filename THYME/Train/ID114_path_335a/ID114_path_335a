Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Residual microscopic foci of moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma are identified (approximately 1.5 x 0.8  x 0.4 cm in extent) in a background of an annular ulcer (6.0 x 4.2 x 0.9 cm).  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not identified.  The tumor extends to within 4.2 cm of the radial resection margin.  Multiple (17) regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. [AJCC ypT3 N0 MX]

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in FCWI MduvAgym.

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal rectal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectosigmoid, proximal rectal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and sigmoid colon"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 27.7 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 6.0 x 4.2 x 0.9 cm annular mass is present within the rectum, 4.4 cm distal mucosal margin and 4.2 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by COX

B.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal margin"" is a 1.8 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm anastomotic ring.  The mucosa is unremarkable.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WILLIAMSON.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal sigmoid margin"" is a 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm anastomotic ring.  The mucosa is unremarkable.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WILLIAMSON.
