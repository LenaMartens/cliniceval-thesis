#1 Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma
Ms. Loveland continues to do quite well.  She has undergone a hepatic metastasectomy as well as resection of a perisigmoid nodule.  There is no other evidence of metastatic disease on her CT-scan today or that was seen during her procedure.
Ms. Loveland is recovering well from her surgery, and we discussed her postoperative management today.  I feel that adjuvant chemotherapy may play a role in this case, especially given the fact that she had approximately a three-month holiday from chemotherapy prior to her surgery.  The goal here would be to eradicate any remaining micrometastatic disease.  We could use something like four to six cycles of FOLFOX in this setting.  Ms. Loveland states that she is not excited to undergo further chemotherapy and states that she would rather follow-up with serial CT scans and only utilize chemotherapy if needed with progression.  Thus, we will follow her with serial CT scans every three-months, and if there is evidence of recurrence, we will start chemotherapy at that time.
#2 Hypertension
Ms. Loveland is keeping a hypertension log, and her blood pressures at-home seem to be consistently in the 125 to 135/74 to 80 range.  It is slightly higher here in clinic today once again, but Ms. Loveland is very hesitant to start any antihypertensives, and given her readings at-home, I do not feel pressed to start anything at this time.
#3 Impaired glucose tolerance
Ms. Loveland states that she was discharged on Lantus but is only taking it intermittently now out of the hospital.  I will obtain a hemoglobin A1c today to determine exactly her status and if needed will pursue this further.
#4 Hyperkalemia
I suspect this is a spurious value given Ms. Loveland has never been hyperkalemic before.  We will recheck this today and if abnormal, we will give her a call back.
I have discussed this case at length with Dr. Sims, my supervising oncologist for the day.  He was essential in the information of the assessment and plan.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.
ADDENDUM:  Repeat potassium 4.9.  HgbA1c 10.0.  Called Mrs. Loveland to inform her of these results and the importance of following-up for these elevated blood sugars.  I will refer her to our General internal medicine clinic to establish care for both her impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension.  green 5/14/10 2017)

Ms. Loveland is a 72-year-old female with the following oncologic history:
1.  July 15, 2009 - presented at GMHC Emergency Room with bilateral lower quadrant abdominal pain.  She was noted to have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.3.  CT-scan showed an 11- x 18- x 17-cm mass which appeared ovarian in origin and invaded into the uterus, the left superior pelvic side wall, and around the rectum.  There were multiple bilobar liver metastases and multiple implants in the abdomen.
2.  July 17, 2009 - colonoscopy showed a large friable lesion at 40 cm.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  July 20, 2009 - taken by Dr. Mello for a total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, anterior resection of the sigmoid, and total omentectomy.   Surgical pathology from the right ovary showed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma while the anterior sigmoid mass demonstrated grade 3 adenocarcinoma forming a 9- x 4.5- x 4-cm annular mass invading through all layers of the bowel wall to involve both the pericolonic fat and the visceral peritoneum.  There were negative surgical margins, and 1 (of 16) regional lymph nodes was positive.  The bladder peritoneum was involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma and omentectomy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma forming two masses.
4.  August 25, 2009, through December 2, 2009 - Eight cycles of FOLFOX plus Avastin therapy.  The dose of 5-FU had to be decreased 10% starting with cycle number two due to diarrhea.  This therapy led to good response with a CEA that was 109 preoperatively, dropping to 7.2 following cycle number eight.  Serial CT scans during therapy also showed continuing decrease in hepatic and peritoneal disease burden.
5.  December 2009 through March 2010, Ms. Loveland was on a chemotherapy holiday per her request.  She did not have any significant toxicities but had mild fatigue, cytopenias, odynophagia, and toe numbness.  In March of 2010, her CEA had risen from a nadir of 7.2 to 61, and a CT-scan revealed slight progression of some of her liver lesions.
Since I last saw Ms. Loveland, she has proceeded to the operating room to undergo metastasectomy by Dr. Sherman on April 5, 2010.  He performed a right hepatectomy, cholecystectomy, and excision of a perisigmoid nodule.  There was no obvious evidence of other intraabdominal metastatic disease apart from the liver lesions and the perisigmoid nodule, all of which came back consistent with adenocarcinoma on pathology review.
Ms. Loveland states that she has done quite well following the surgery.  She states that over the past week, she is getting back to completely normal and has returned to work full-time.  She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, cough, shortness-of-breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in her bowel or bladder habits.  She states that her toe numbness is stable to slightly improved, and her odynophagia is completely resolved.  She otherwise has no complaints and is quite pleased with the way in which she has recovered from her surgery.
