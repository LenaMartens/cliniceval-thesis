Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, right upper abdominal wall, excision:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary, forming a mass (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm).  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.

B.  Soft tissue, right lower abdomen, excision:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary, forming a mass (3.3 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm).  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.

C.  Soft tissue, umbilical mass, excision:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic primary forming a mass (4.1 x 3.9 x 3.0 cm).  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.
D.  Small bowel, nodule, excisional biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic primary forming a mass (0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm) involving the serosa and muscularis propria.

E.  Small bowel, nodule #2, excisional biopsy:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic primary forming a mass (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm).

F.  Soft tissue, small bowel nodule #3, biopsy:  Necrotic cystic nodule; no viable tumor identified.  

G.  Small bowel, mesentery, biopsy:  Negative for tumor. 

H.  Colon, partial resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a mass (1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm) involving the serosa extending through the muscularis propria and submucosa to focally involve the mucosa.  A separate nodule (0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm) of ovarian parenchyma involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma is also identified within the serosal adipose tissue. The colon shows diverticulosis with multiple (8) diverticula.  A single (of 6) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

I.	Soft tissue, cul-de-sac, biopsy:  Involved by metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
