LABORATORY VALUES
Hemoglobin is currently 9.8 and most recent creatinine was 1.8.
IMPRESSION/PLAN
#1 Colon mass
#2 Iron-deficiency anemia
PLAN
Mr. Smith is an 86-year-old male who has multiple medical problems in the face of an hepatic flexure mass and iron-deficiency anemia, which has required blood transfusions in just two-weeks' time.  The patient is not obstructed from this mass.  We will await the pathology results in order to discuss further options for this patient.  I did review with the patient that since his mass is bleeding and it has bled in only two-weeks' time since his last transfusion that he may benefit from having a resection. This is the likely etiology for his anemia, given that his extensive workup previously has been otherwise unremarkable.  The patient, in general, wishes to be aggressive; however, we must make sure that he is able to tolerate a surgery and has adequate preoperative cardiac clearance.  We will ultimately await the pathology biopsy results in order to better delineate our plan of care.  If there is carcinoma in the biopsy, he should have a staging CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis and a recent chest X-ray.
This patient will be discussed with Dr. Hutchinson.  Thank-you for this consult.

It should be noted that the patient was irritable at the time of evaluation and did not always answer questions in a straightforward manner.
The patient is an 86-year-old male with an extensive past medical history, including a history of iron-deficiency anemia, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic renal insufficiency, who presented to the emergency room yesterday for symptoms of fatigue, bilateral lower-extremity pain similar to his claudication pain, and he was noted to have a hemoglobin of 7, which is a recent drop from a prior draw.  On August 11 he was evaluated for similar symptoms, and he was admitted with a hemoglobin of 6.4, transfused 2 units, and ultimately bumped to 9.5.  Now 2 weeks later, his hemoglobin has again declined and he has exacerbation of his presenting symptoms.  During this hospital admission, he was admitted with a hemoglobin of 7.1, which has now increased to 9.8 after 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The patient describes these symptoms of fatigue and leg pain that seem to occur with his anemia.  He describes the leg pain as similar to his claudication or leg ischemia symptoms that significantly worsens when he has the symptomatic anemia.  He does not have any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He has two to four, soft, formed stools per day.  He does not know if there is any blood or blackness to the stools as he states he does not look in the toilet or pay attention to this.  Per history in the clinic chart, he did report previous dark or black stools, which he attributed to a food supplement he was taking.  He does describe anorexia with associated ten-pound weight-loss in the last few months.  He denies any hematemesis.  He had a colonoscopy performed today with a decent amount of stool that did note an hepatic flexure mass, which was flat and broad and plaque-like.  The exact dimensions were not delineated in the operative report.  Biopsies were obtained of this mass, and this is the reason for our consultation.  These biopsies are pending.  Other than this mass, there was one small polyp, diverticulosis, and hemorrhoids but no other significant lesions and no active bleeding or impending obstruction.  Upon reviewing his medical record, there is evidence of a colonoscopy performed in January of 2003, which demonstrated diverticulosis, as well as a small rectal polyp, which came back as a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  The patient was recommended to have a colonoscopy in five years but did not do this.  He was also recommended, per hospital notes, to have colonoscopy following his admission two-weeks ago but deferred this colonoscopy since he was feeling better.  He now presents with similar symptoms and obviously a hepatic flexure mass on his colonoscopy.  He has had an EGD in the past, which was unremarkable.
