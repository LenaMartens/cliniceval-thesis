Labs drawn 9/30/10:
Hemoglobin 14.4  WBC 10.9  PLT 329  Sodium 140  Potassium 4.8  Calcium 9.4  Glucose 102  Alk-phos 81  AST 18  T. bilirubin 0.7  Creatinine 1.4  Albumin 4.6  CEA 75.6
Labs drawn 10/7/10: Prothrombin time 9.8  INR 1.0
30Sep2010 13:52: VENTRICULAR RATE 61. Normal sinus rhythm. Nonspecific ST and T-wave abnormality. No previous ECGs available.
30-Sep-2010 13:51:00  Exam: Chest-- PA & Lateral: Chest; 2 views:
Sternotomy with mediastinal clips. Prominent fat pad at the cardiac apex. Mild fibrotic changes in the bases. Interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded. High-resolution chest CT would be helpful in further evaluation, if clinically indicated. Calcified aorta. Osteopenia.
04-Oct-2010 09:44:00  Exam: NMPET/CT trunk
F-18 FDG PET/CT-scan was performed from the mid brain through the mid thighs with CT fusion imaging for attenuation correction and anatomic coregistration only. Comparison: Outside chest CT from September 23, 2010.
History: Colon cancer, status-post right hemicolectomy 2003. Status-post chemotherapy. Likely metachronous colon cancer approximately 40 cm distal to the previous anastomosis.
Clinical Indication: Colon carcinoma restaging. Subsequent treatment strategy.
IMPRESSION: Focal nonmetastatic hypermetabolic colon carcinoma in the sigmoid colon.  Severe sinusitis is seen on the CT.
Findings: There is a 1.5-cm soft-tissue rounded density in the sigmoid colon/left pelvis with SUV max of 9.4 consistent with colon carcinoma. Postoperative changes right hemicolectomy with no increased FDG activity around the anastomosis in the right abdomen. Physiologic FDG activity in the proximal colon. No other focus of FDG activity worrisome for malignancy or metastasis. Slight motion misalignment of the head and neck. Physiologic uptake in the vocal cords. Mild FDG activity in a left inguinal hernia. Significant incidental findings on the low-dose unenhanced CT fusion images: Cyst in the right kidney. Ultrasound evaluation of the
helpful. Multiple cysts throughout all lobes of the liver. Dense arterial calcifications. Postoperative changes CABG. Scarring and atelectasis in the lung bases. Extensive mucosal thickening and suggestion of postoperative changes in the paranasal sinuses consistent with severe chronic sinusitis.
05-Oct-2010 10:13:00  Exam: MRI the abdomen without and with IV contrast.
COMPARISON: PET/CT dated 10/4/2010 and outside CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis dated 9/23/2010.
CONCLUSION/IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease.
FINDINGS: No evidence of metastatic disease. Two small foci of enhancement in segment 6 of the liver (series 11 images 179 and 193) are likely benign. No worrisome hepatic masses. Innumerable hepatic cysts scattered throughout both lobes. 1.2-cm benign porta hepatic lymph node. Cholelithiasis. Bilateral renal cysts. 5-mm pancreatic head cyst could be and IPMN and should be of no clinical significance. Postoperative changes of right hemicolectomy.

Metachronous colon cancer in setting of previous right colon cancer resection.

79 yr old retired vrnhnmu gukgrta who underwent a segmental resection in 2003 for a T3 N0 M0 colon cancer.  He did receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy but did not complete the course due to side-effects. Most recently, his CEA rose to 51.6 and this prompted some evaluations at-home. He underwent a colonoscopy  and was found to have what appeared to be a cancer. He came to Neligh Hospital for definitive evaluation and treatment.
In addition, he has recent history of duodenitis, cold/sinusitis and a history of coronary artery disease. He is currently completing a course of antibiotic therapy for these. He was seen by Dr. Bobby Golden of Pulmonary Medicine for preop evaluation who notes that the patient has clear evidence of obstructive lung disease. He also noted that this is not a contraindication for his surgery because he did not think that the patient was currently having an exacerbation of his condition, however this puts him at a higher risk of postsurgical pulmonary complications. Pulmonary recommendations for pre, peri and postop were made. He comes to the hospital at this time for surgical management.
