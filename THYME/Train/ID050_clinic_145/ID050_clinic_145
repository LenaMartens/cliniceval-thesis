#1 Rectal cancer with synchronous malignant polyp with uncertain margins
I discussed with Mrs. Becnel and her daughter that she predominantly has rectal cancer although she also had cancer found in the sigmoid polyp, and we have unclear margins.  She has not undergone tattooing of either of these areas and will need to go through the standard evaluation for rectal cancer including endoscopic rectal ultrasound, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, and CEA.  We will have her see Dr. Charlie Mccloskey in surgical consultation later this week following her testing.  Discussed the possible need for neoadjuvant treatment.  Due to the location of her tumor, discussed briefly potential surgeries.  It is likely she will need a large abdominal operation, possibly a low-anterior resection versus coloanal.  I think there is a smaller chance she will need a permanent colostomy.  I will see her back with Dr. Mccloskey following her testing.  Prep instructions reviewed.   I discussed with Mrs. Becnel that her siblings need to all undergo colonoscopies if they have not done so and that her children need to start undergoing screening colonoscopies at age 48.
#2 Elevated blood pressure without hypertension
This is mild.  No further evaluation at this time.
#3 History of elevated cholesterol
This has been well-controlled on fish oil.
#4 Sore throat
I do not see evidence of pharyngitis or significant erythema of the posterior pharynx.  She does not have a fever and we will continue with the evaluation as planned.
#5 PAME
Will obtain EKG, chest x-ray, and basic blood work.
Spent 70 minutes reviewing plan of care and discussing rectal cancer evaluation in detail with Mrs. Becnel and her daughter.  All questions were answered.  Given laparoscopic colon book.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at Indian River Hospital.  She will check at-home whether she has one and bring this if she does.
Code status discussion:  Discussed with Mrs. Becnel and her daughter.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Becnel is a 58-year-old female from 71016 Lancaster, with a six-month history of intermittent rectal bleeding.  She had never undergone a screening colonoscopy.  Due to her bleeding she went in for evaluation and on December 10 underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a large circumferential rectal mass approximately 10-cm from the anal verge. Biopsies were obtained with slides reviewed here revealing invasive moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  She was also found to have a 3-cm polyp at 40 cm in the sigmoid.  This appears to have been completely removed by hot snare polypectomy per the colonoscopy report, and pathology here revealed invasive moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising within the tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  The resection margins could not be evaluated from the specimen.  She also had a-1-cm sigmoid colon polyp which was removed, and our pathology has confirmed this as a hyperplastic polyp.  It was not mentioned that any tattooing was performed.  She has not undergone other restaging studies and is here for definitive treatment. Her colonoscopy was also notable for sigmoid diverticulosis.  She denies a history of diverticulitis
Mrs. Becnel has no family history of colorectal cancer.  She denies rectal or abdominal pain.  Her weight has been stable.  She denies fatigue.  She has had a change in her bowel habits in that over the last three-to-four months she has been going three-to-four times a day when her normal was one-to-two times a day previously.  She is having bloody discharge at times.  Her appetite has been stable.  She has been noticing more flatus.  She denies fecal incontinence but has occasional fecal urgency.  She is not on blood thinners.  .
