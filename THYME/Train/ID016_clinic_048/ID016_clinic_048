I spent an hour with the patient and her husband discussing the natural history of colon cancer with particular emphasis on patients who had no cancer in the lymph nodes and also with patient who had cancer in the lymph nodes.  We discussed what chemotherapy does or does not do to patients after surgery.  The fact she is otherwise very healthy and that she had cancer in one lymph node tells me that we should try chemotherapy.
The patient in the beginning was not too keen about receiving chemotherapy, concerned about the potential side-effects of this treatment as well as the impact in quality of life.  I certainly understand this very well, but, in an otherwise very healthy 75-year-old woman, my bias is to recommend at least one cycle of chemotherapy for her to ascertain the side-effects of the treatment and then, if she does not like it, either we cut down the dose or just stop it.  After many, many discussions about the pros and cons of chemotherapy or no chemotherapy, she has agreed to try it.  The question then is which one is the best chemotherapy option for a healthy 75-year-old woman.  We discussed the usual treatment with FOLFOX that will entail six-months of chemotherapy every two-weeks with a regimen that contains oxaliplatin.  It is very likely that with oxaliplatin she will developed neuropathy that will require this to eventually be stopped.  Data from clinical trials tell us that oxaliplatin may not be necessary in patients older than 65.  Based on this, I think that she needs chemotherapy and it does not have to include oxaliplatin.  Options then will be to use FOLFOX without oxaliplatin for which she will require a catheter and potential complications of a catheter versus just using Xeloda.  Xeloda is an oral chemotherapy agent that for the most part is well-tolerated.
Now, I explained to the patient and her husband that for the most part that being well-tolerated does not exclude the potential of significant side-effects.  This is a fine line of discussion with the patient because I think that she should get chemotherapy, and I cannot promise that she will not get sick.  I think that starting chemotherapy with a slight decrease in the dose using Xeloda and then see her back in three weeks is a very reasonable compromise.
We diagnosis carefully that Xeloda, although is a pill, it is the real thing.  I mean, this is chemotherapy, and as such can cause side-effects.  The side-effects include fatigue, sometimes patients get nausea, sometimes they get skin rash, or diarrhea, or sores in the mouth.  Chemotherapy can lower the defenses and cause infections; it could also cause bleeding.  From the positive side, it is rare for patients to lose hair.  Again, most patients taking Xeloda do well.
I wrote a prescription for Xeloda.  She will discuss this with Dr. Sherwood who she is very close because of years of seeing him.  Actually, I did call-Dr. Sherwood, but he was not available.  I will be e-mailing this dictation to him.
I will be happy to continue to participate in the care of Mrs. Weiss even if she does not want to receive chemotherapy.

I had the pleasure to meet with Mrs. Weiss and her husband.  She was referred to us by Dr. Sullivan.
The patient is a delightful 75-year-old woman from Palmdale Otter, retired from the phone company, here for our advice regarding what to do after resection of colon cancer.  I reviewed the Sacred Heart Hospital records including Dr. Weber note, pathology report, and surgical report, and the note from Ohio, NP, who saw Mrs. Weiss in the hospital after surgery.
Briefly, she is otherwise a very healthy 75-year-old female who about four weeks ago underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for a T3, N1 colon cancer and has recovered from surgery without any complications.  She is up and about and asymptomatic and has for the most part an unremarkable past medical history.
