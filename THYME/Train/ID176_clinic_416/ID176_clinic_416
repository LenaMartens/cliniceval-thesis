#1 Stage III completely resected colon cancer
This disease was diagnosed in June 2010 and resected by Dr. Adams.  There is no evidence of metastatic disease on CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis as well as on chest imaging.  I had a long discussion with Mrs. Barrett and her husband.  I explained that in this situation, a stage III colon carcinoma, we usually recommend adjuvant chemotherapy to decrease the likelihood of recurrence of cancer.  I explained that even with chemotherapy, the cancer could recur and on the other hand even without chemotherapy, there is a chance that she is cured of the cancer.  I emphasized that because of several risk factors including lymphovascular invasion, stage III disease, and poorly-differentiated histology, I would certainly recommend adjuvant chemotherapy at this point.  Chemotherapy should consist of the FOLFOX combination.  We discussed side-effects of such chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting, immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, mucositis, and a small chance of coronary vasospasm.  Mrs. Barrett is still eager to go ahead with this therapy.  She would like to have it started here at TSH and then look for an oncologist in Tex.  I have therefore scheduled placement of a Port-a-Cath hopefully for tomorrow and start of chemotherapy with FOLFOX for Monday.  I also explained that follow-up would be required after completion of all therapy.  This should consist of physical examination, a CEA, and other blood work three-months after completion, then a CT-scan after six-months, and a repeat colonoscopy after one-year.  Mrs. Barrett would like to come here for the latter, I have therefore scheduled a colonoscopy,  a return visit with me, as well as a CT-scan and blood work.
#2 Inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis
She will follow-up with Dr. Lester later this afternoon for this.

Mrs. Barrett is a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Crohn's colitis in 1998 and abnormal liver test, consistent with PCS in 2004.  She was followed by yearly colonoscopies for her Crohn's colitis, most recently in September 2009.  Reportedly, no evidence of malignancy was ever found; however, Mrs. Barrett started to feel fatigued especially during the past winter.  Since the fatigue was progressive, she finally sought medical attention again.  In June 2010, she came to SPCMC and was found to be anemic.  A colonoscopy was done on June 25, 2010, the operative report describes mild right and transverse colon inflammatory change, a diminutive rectal polyp, and inflammation of the ileocecal valve.  Random biopsies were taken and the pathology report describes invasive poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma at the ileocecal valve.  On July 2, 2010, she was taken to the operating room by Dr. Adams for a right hemicolectomy.  The pathology report describes poorly-differentiated grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.2- x 4.1- x 0.9-cm annular circumferential and ulcerated mass in the ascending colon.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion was present.  Surgical resection margins were negative; 4 (of 48) regional lymph nodes were involved with adenocarcinoma; therefore, the disease was staged pT3, N2.
Mrs. Barrett now comes to Bergen Regional Medical Center to discuss further therapy.  She states that she has nicely recovered from the surgery, that she has no pain, that she feels back to her normal activity level, that she has good appetite, and has gained 1 pound since the surgery.  She had no medical complaints.
