LABORATORY
Her EKG today showed sinus rhythm with marked sinus arrhythmia, first-degree AV block, left axis deviation, and no specific intraventricular conduction delay.  Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous hypertension.  She had an echocardiogram which showed mild left ventricular enlargement.  No regional wall motion abnormalities.  Ejection fraction of 54%.  Increased left ventricular filling pressure, and her estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 79.  There was mild decrease in her right ventricular systolic function with RIMP of 0.57 and TAPSE of 17.
Her BUN was 25, creatinine 1.3, glucose 148, hemoglobin 11.8, PT 10, INR 1, calcium 9.6, NT-Pro BNP 723, TSH 2.7.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN
#1 Recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the colon
The patient is scheduled to be seen by Dr. Holland.  We feel the patient has significant risk from this surgery. However, her risks are acknowledged as significant stemming from obesity, hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and coronary artery disease. I have not recommended pursuing evaluation of myocardial ischemia since she does not have compelling symptoms and therapeutic alternatives would be limited in order to avoid clopidogrel. Her pulmonary hypertension may have regressed somewhat but overall is essentially stable of moderate degree. It will be important to manage her volume status carefully during the perioperative period and to maintain adequate oxygenation. If necessary nitric oxide could be employed if there was suspicion that her pulmonary hemodynamics had deteriorated though I do not think that extended intervascular PA pressure monitoring should be necessary. We feel that the patient can have the surgery done.  Volume overload and pressure overload to be avoided in the perioperative period and to watch out for perioperative myocardial ischemia.
#2 Pulmonary hypertension which may be idiopathic but is compounded by her obesity, previous evidence of nocturnal hypoventilation, hypertensive left heart disease with elevated left filling pressure
We will continue her sildenafil at the same dose.
#3 Coronary artery disease
She is on appropriate medication for her coronary disease including aspirin, lisinopril, and simvastatin.
#4 Status-post percutaneous coronary intervention of distal left anterior descending lesion in 2007
#5 Systemic hypertension
#6 History of hyperparathyroidism, status-post left lower parathyroidectomy in August 2009
Case discussed with Dr. Jones

Seventy-four-year-old lady with past medical history significant for morbid obesity, history of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension that was treated initially with IV treprostinil which was tolerated poorly, and patient was switched to sildenafil.  She is still taking it at the present time.  She had a past medical history significant of coronary artery disease, status-post stent placement on March 19, 2007.  She had a coronary angiogram done in November 2008, which showed that patient had 60% obtuse marginal stenosis, proximal 50% right coronary artery stenosis, and a 30% middle left anterior descending artery stenosis.  Her estimated right ventricular systolic pressure by ECHO was 51 in July 2009.  The right ventricular systolic pressure by ECHO was 79 today, and her TAPSE was 17.  Ms. Sharer was seen by her primary-care physician in December 2009 and was diagnosed with anemia for which she was placed on iron supplement.  Later she developed bloody diarrhea, and when she informed her primary-care physician, a colonoscopy was arranged and done on March 15, 2010. Colonoscopy showed ulcerating mass in the cecum.  Pathology report revealed adenocarcinoma.  A CT-scan of the abdomen was done and showed no significant metastasis.  The patient is scheduled to see Dr. Holland for further evaluation and to discuss the option for treatment of her colon carcinoma.  The patient is sedentary, and, therefore, it is difficult to judge her functional status, but she states she gets dyspneic when she dresses herself or when she takes a shower.  She is likely stage WHO III in her functional status.  No orthopnea, no syncope, no palpitations, no cough, no fever, no chills.  She has bilateral lower leg edema that has been stable and not increasing.  The patient is supposed to be on continuous oxygen supplement, but she has not been using it for awhile because she feels it did not make her feel any better.  She had a sleep study done on May 19, 2008, which showed obstructive/mixed hypopnea but patient did not have a CPAP, and she was not interested in getting one because she felt uncomfortable when they tried it during the sleep study.  She successfully underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy on August 11, 2009, for hyperparathyroidism, and her calcium has been stable since then.
