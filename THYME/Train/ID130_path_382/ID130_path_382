Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, colectomy:  Moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 4.5 x 4.2 x 2.0 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into pericolic adipose tissue.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margnis are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  One of fifteen (1/15) regional lymph nodes are positive for tumor.  [AJCC pT3 N1 MX]

Addendum Diagnosis
Due to the patient's young age, reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC will be performed; when completed, results will be available in OEJT SggyGiyy (molecular genetics report).
