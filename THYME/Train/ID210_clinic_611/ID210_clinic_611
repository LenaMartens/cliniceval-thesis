#1 Rectal cancer
I have reviewed his outside CT.  Concerns certainly are the large tumor.  It appears to not be obstructing at this time.  We prefer likely chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery, but he will be getting an EUS on Thursday.  I am trying to get him to see Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology.  We did bring up the issue of whether or not intraop radiation would be a possibility.  Genetic testing would also be a possibility for this gentleman.  I did bring up briefly the particulars for surgery.  Options certainly would be APR which is my first option, a coloanal anastomosis as a second option.  All questions answered.

Mr. Alexander is a 42-year-old gentleman with recent diagnosis of rectal cancer.  He presented basically with rectal bleeding for about two-months, also complained of pain in the perianal area.  His bowel movements currently are very loose.  He does have a fairly significant family history for colon cancer which will be dictated later, but to continue with the history, he had a colonoscopy done on August 18.  What was found was a large, near circumferential rectal mass in the low rectum.  It was an incomplete colonoscopy to the splenic flexure only because of a poor prep.  Biopsy at-home was consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma.  This then led to a CT abdomen and pelvis performed on August 19.  Overall the liver and spleen look normal.  The spleen looks slightly larger than normal but otherwise appeared normal.  The patient did have a very, very full bladder.  There was an ill-defined mass in the rectum with concern for involvement of the prostate.  He is here then for a second opinion with regard to treatment.  Hemoglobin at-home was 9.7.  CEA at-home was high at 2.9.

Per report, he has a brother, age 46, with a colon polyp removed last year.  His father who is alive at age 82 has "many polyps" removed with multiple basal and squamous skin cancers.  Upon questioning, he reported he probably has had about six polyps removed.  Patient's mother Mrhjobt had tongue cancer with metastatic disease in the liver and brain.  A paternal aunt, Qatg, is alive at age 78.  Qatg has eight children, and one child has had a mass removed from the colon which was reportedly benign.  This patient's grandmother, Zctywswbg, died at age 92 without any history of colon cancer.  Family members that have had colon and rectal cancers are his father Etcq's cousins.  There are at least three cousins of his father who had colon cancer.  The youngest one had colon cancer at the age of 44.  The other two had their cancers in their late 70s and 80s.  In terms of the grandparent's line, as mentioned earlier, the patient's grandmother, Zctywswbg, had no cancer, but Zctywswbg's sister, Vtmnj, had colon cancer at the age of 53.  Moving one generation further back, Tlqxp and Jwgyiv, which would be his great-grandparents, had colon cancers in their 60s and 50s, so patient has a fairly extensive family history of colon cancer.  There is one other relative with breast cancer and one with lung cancer.

I do not see anything external, but on rectal exam, I can feel a mass located anterior.  It feels fairly fixed.  Really palpable very easily with my finger.
