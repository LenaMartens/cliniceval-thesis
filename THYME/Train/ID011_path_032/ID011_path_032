Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, portion transverse, resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon, 3.3 cm from the closest mucosal surgical resection margin.  The tumor superficially invades the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (5) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Adenomyoma (2.2 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm) in the fundus.  Cholelithiasis, with multiple (20) mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) in the lumen and multiple (4) mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) within the wall of the adenomyoma.  Minimal cholesterolosis is identified.   

Photograph taken.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion transverse colon"" is a transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 9.8 cm of colon and a 23.2 x 11.5 x 1.4 cm portion of omentum.  A 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm ulcerated, polypoid mass is present within the transverse colon, 3.3 cm from the closest mucosal surgical resection margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into muscle.  Multiple (5) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CLARKE.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is an 8.3 x 4.7 x 2.2 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  There are multiple (20) mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) in the lumen and multiple (4) mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) within the wall of the adenomyoma .  There is a 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm mass (adenomyoma) in the fundus.  Minimal cholesterolosis is identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Photograph taken.  Grossed by CLARKE.
