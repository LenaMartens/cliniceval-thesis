Final Diagnosis
B.  Portion sigmoid, rectum, resection:  Invasive poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 4.9 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm annular mass in the rectum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  Additionally, there are multiple soft tissue deposits of adenocarcinoma within the pericolic fat near regional lymph nodes.  The tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the radial resection margin.  Multiple (19) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

F.  Liver, segment 7, resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.
G.  Liver, segment 7-#2, resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma forming a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm mass.  The surgical margins are free of tumor (minimum tumor free margin 1.2 cm.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.
H.  Liver, segment 5, resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.
I.  Liver, portion 4b and 5, resection:  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma forming a nodule measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The margins of resection are free of tumor (minimum tumor free distance 3.0 cm).  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.

AJCC 7th edition pathologic stage - pT3N0(V2)M1.

A.  Lymph nodes, periaortic apical, lymphadenectomy:  A single periaortic apical lymph node is negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.

C.  Soft tissue, rectal margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.
D.  Soft tissue, sigmoid margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

E.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis/18 mixed stones measuring 0.2 to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lissa Sandlin, M.D.


This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
