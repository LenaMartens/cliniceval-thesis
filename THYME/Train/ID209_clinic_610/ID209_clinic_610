This will be a multidisciplinary approach to locally recurrent rectal cancer in the right upper pelvic region.  The tumor encases the right internal iliac vessels, the distal right ureter, and likely portion of the lumbosacral plexus.
Dr Nieman discussed in detail the surgery, the role of intraoperative radiation therapy, and possible outcomes.  They also talked extensively about risks of the surgery.  The other team members will be meeting with her, and Dr Nieman will have a final discussion with the team members on the day before surgery regarding coordination of the procedure and the final plan.  She understands.  All questions were answered.

Recurrent rectal cancer.

This patient is a 48-year-old female from Minnesota Independence, diagnosed with rectal cancer in September 2003.  She had a tumor 7-cm from the verge and was treated with preop chemoradiation therapy along with Xeloda.  She received 45 Gy in 25 fractions using a four-field approach.  She underwent low-anterior resection in January 2004 and had T3, N0, cancer with 15 negative nodes.  She received adjuvant capecitabine for six-months.  She subsequently relapsed with a solitary right lung metastasis, resected May 6, 2005.  This was grade 2 adenocarcinoma, and she received postoperative FOLFOX with Avastin.  She now has evidence of a pelvic relapse.  Her CEA is elevated at 22.8.  A PET scan shows hypermetabolic uptake in the upper right presacral region at the level of S1 and S2.  CT-scan shows a 2.2- x 2.4-cm soft-tissue mass encasing the right internal iliac artery, consistent with recurrent tumor.  MRI scan shows the mass to measure 1.9 x 2.2 x 1.2-cm anterior to the S1 segment of the sacrum.  It abuts the sacrum but does not appear to invade the bone.  It abuts the right external iliac vessels and appears to encase the internal iliac vessels.  The ureter is encased by the mass, and a ureteral stent has been placed.  The patient has been seen by Drs. Carter and Nieman, and they feel that this is potentially resectable.
Dale True has completed 30 Gy in 15 fraction for treatment of recurrent rectal cancer.  Her last treatment was October 26, 2010.  She tolerated this well.  She is scheduled for surgery and intraoperative radiation therapy tomorrow.
