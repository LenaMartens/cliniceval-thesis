Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (9.5 x 8.0 x 2.8 cm) located in the ascending colon, 7.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (21 of 34) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  A separate tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia is also identified.  [AJCC, 7th edition pT3N2bMX]

B.  Ovary and fallopian tube, left, salpingo-oophorectomy:  The left ovary shows a follicular cyst (4.8 x 4.1 x 4.0 cm).  The left fallopian tube is without diagnostic abnormality.
C.  Ovary, right, oophorectomy:  Ovary, right, oophorectomy:  Without diagnostic abnormality.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon, portion transverse colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 6.0 cm of terminal ileum, 19.5 cm of colon, and a 7.5 x 0.8 cm appendix.  A 9.5 x 8.0 x 2.8 cm polypoid mass is present within the ascending colon, 9.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The mass is 7.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  There are multiple (2) polyps (1.6 cm and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) within the ascending colon located 3.0 cm from the distal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat with the largest grossly positive lymph node measuring 1.9 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MCKAY

B.  Received fresh labeled ""left ovary"" is a 74.0 gram, 7.4 x 6.3 x 4.1 cm ovary.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and a cystic (4.8 x 4.1 x 4.0 cm) cut surface.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by BOHAN

C.  Received fresh labeled ""right ovary"" is a 3.1 x 2.8 x 1.7 cm ovary.  The ovary has a ragged outer surface with multiple cysts (ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension).  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by STURDIVANT.



Addendum Diagnosis
The appendix is unremarkable.
