Final Diagnosis
A.  Seminal vesicle, left margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.

B.  Seminal vesicle, right margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.

C.  Rectoprostatic tissue, left Denonvilliers' fascia, excision:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Sigmoid, rectum, and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (5.3 x 3.2 x 1.4 cm) with treatment effect, located in the rectum, 3.3 cm from the dentate line.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 0.4 cm of the radial margin.  The attached seminal vesicle is uninvolved by tumor.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (1 of 38) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
