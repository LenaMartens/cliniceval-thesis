Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 6.8 x 6.3 x 1.6 cm ulcerative, necrotic, annular mass in the cecum involving the ileocecal valve.  Tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve the pericolic fat and the free serosal surface (visceral peritoneum).  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of lumen.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (2 of 33) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  [AJCC pT4N1]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
