#1 Colon carcinoma (T4, N2b, M0) stage IIIC
I reviewed these findings with Mr. Ralston and his sister.  We went over his current clinical findings as well as surgical results.  His post-op scans are without evidence of recurrence and the pulmonary nodule is also unchanged.  His CEA has normalized, and he is feeling much better following drainage of the fluid collection.  I did review the case with his surgeon, Dr. Stein.  I asked about the path report showing a nest of cells in a retroperitoneal biopsy.  Dr. Stein states that this specimen was taken out quite early in the course the surgery.  This was not something that was taken out at the end of en bloc resection.  This was reviewed again with the patient.
We discussed pathology and the fact that he has extensive nodal involvement.  Rish of recurrence is quite high but we would hope that he would benefit from FOLFOX chemotherapy.  I reviewed use of monoclonal antibody in this setting.  Unfortunately we do not have proof that patients will benefit from additional bevacizumab or cetuximab, therefore, I have recommended use of FOLFOX.  We went over logistics as well as side-effects.  We reviewed the neuropathy side-effects associated with oxaliplatin.  One needs to monitor for more significant, persistent neuropathy toward the end of his six-month course.  If indeed he is having more persistent neuropathy, one may wish to eliminate the oxaliplatin after eight, nine, or ten cycles.
We also talked about further follow-up.  Dr. Stein was concerned about the risk of recurrence and was suggesting more frequent scans.  This could be considered half-way through his adjuvant therapy and then at the end of his adjuvant therapy.  Routine follow-up quarter every three to six-months can be done after completion of treatment.  We went over potential sites of recurrence as well as natural history of recurrent disease.  He is aware of possible treatment options in the future and is hoping for continued benefit from the treatments.  I would be happy to see him in the future should he wish to return here for routine follow-up.  His sister can be in touch with us, and we will contact Dr. Hammitt regarding our final recommendations.

#1 Resected locally advanced colon carcinoma.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  April 2010 - he presented at a general medical exam complaining of bright-red blood over the last five to six-months and also had anemia.
2.  April 20, 2010 - colonoscopy found a circumferential mass at the hepatic flexure.
3.  April 22, 2010 - referred to MetroWest County Hospital Clinic.  CT-scan showed a large right-sided colon mass and an indeterminate 4-mm nodule near the major fissure in the lung.  No evidence though of definitive distant metastasis.  CEA was 5.4.
4.  April 23, 2010 - colonoscopy was repeated, again identifying the hepatic flexure mass.  This was biopsied and found to be grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features.  HNPCC testing was negative.  Also noted were other polyps.
5.  April 27, 2010 - taken by Dr. Stein for resection of the hepatic flexure mass.  There was direct invasion into the duodenum and segment VII of the liver, as well as the pylorus.  Pathology showed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features and possible neuroendocrine features involving 15 of 22 lymph nodes (T4N2M0, Stage IIIc).
Post-op the patient did have complications with fever and abscess formation.  He was hospitalized locally.  He was put on antibiotics and had a drain placed.  Drain was removed and his symptoms have recovered.  Today he had left chest Port-A-Cath placed.  His bowels back to normal.  He still has been having some abdominal pain-related surgical site.  This is improving.
