I carefully reviewed with the patient and her husband the natural history of rectal cancer.  I agree with the treatment as per our colleagues in 13090.  Mrs. Work has recovered from the recent chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is asymptomatic and fully active.  Although there is history of depression, this appears to be very well-controlled.  She was laughable, appropriate, in good spirits today.
Regarding the anterior chest pain, this did not have a cardiac source, neither appeared to be pulmonary embolism.  She had a Port-A-Cath in place for the chemotherapy administration.  I did not notice a check for DVT.  We may need to address this with Dr. Guidry from Colorectal Surgery.
Mrs. Work will see Dr. Guidry from Colorectal Surgery later.  The patient and her husband are aware that she is likely to receive further chemotherapy after surgery.

Consultation for rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

1. January 2006, rectal cancer, adenocarcinoma 12-cm from the anal verge, a low-anterior resection performed for a T2, N0 disease, observed.
2. April 30, 2010, adenocarcinoma 12-cm from the anal verge, at the anastomosis, and the rectal ultrasound showed this to be T3, N1.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed left posterior lateral presacral adenopathy as well as perirectal lymph nodes.  Treated with 5-FU by continuous infusion concurrently with radiation therapy.
I had the pleasure to meet Mrs. Work, a delightful 65-year-old woman from the suburbs of Pine Bluff, otherwise very healthy.  The history is as above.  She received 5-FU with continuous infusion concurrently with radiation therapy.  Also 5-FU was initially decreased by 25% due to mucositis.  Later, she developed anterior neck pain and anterior and superior chest pain with the dose of 5-FU decreased by another 25%.  She did not have a pulmonary embolism as per CT angiogram, and a cardiac evaluation including stress test came back negative.  The pain slowly improved over days with the use of Vicodin, and it disappeared even while receiving 5-FU.  She received her last dose of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on July 6, 2010.  She is up and about and asymptomatic.
