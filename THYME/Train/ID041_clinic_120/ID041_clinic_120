IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Stage II (T2, N0, M0) adenocarcinoma of the appendix
We were able to share the preliminary pathology results with Mrs. Hildreth today.  We were able also to review their significance with her and her husband, most notably that we typically do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in the setting of stage II colon/appendiceal cancer.
We emphasized that we feel that her prognosis is quite good without any further treatment and that it would be reasonable for her to be followed in the GI Neoplasia Clinic for followup of this malignancy.  She should undergo a colonoscopy in one-year as part of this followup, and we emphasized this to her today.  This can be either scheduled at the time of her discharge to be coordinated with her other appointments (Cardiology, Endocrinology), or Mrs. Hildreth can contact her cardiologist Dr. Stewart to help coordinate this when she is due to come see him next.
Thank-you very much for involving us in Mrs. Hildreth's care.  We will not schedule her for any outpatient oncology followup; as mentioned above, she can follow-up with the GI Neoplasia Clinic.  Please feel free to contact us with questions or concerns via the medical oncology consult service pager (623-521-32968).
ADDENDUM:  Final pathology report as below consistent with preliminary results (marcus 9/8/10 0930)
A.  Colon, cecum, ascending, transverse, resection:  Invasive
moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4), adenocarcinoma, forming a
1.9 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm mass in the appendiceal orifice arising in a
background of appendiceal diffuse serrated adenoma.  Adenocarcinoma
invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins
are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (18) regional lymph
nodes are negative for tumor.  Biopsy site change is identified in
the ascending colon.  The bowel serosa is densely fibrotic,
predominantly in the ileum.
With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

Mrs. Hildreth is a 58-year-old female who was in her usual state of health until June of 2010 when she was hospitalized with a small-bowel obstruction.  Her symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort were treated with conservative measures; and after a number of days, she returned  back to her baseline.
She did quite well without recurrent symptoms until early August of 2010 when she developed persistent and significant rectal bleeding.  For this reason, she underwent a colonoscopy on August 18, 2010.  Per the procedure note, this was a technically difficult study with evidence of a rigid distal sigmoid consistent with postradiation change as well as prominent mucosal folds of the ileocecal valve which were biopsied.  Of note, she also underwent an EGD at this time which revealed grade A erosive esophagitis.  The biopsy results from the ileocecal region revealed low-grade dysplasia with elements of focal high-grade dysplasia.  These findings, in concert with the rectal bleeding, led to a second colonoscopy on August 31, 2010.  During this procedure, an ulcerated mass lesion was noted just proximal to the ileal orifice which appeared to involve the appendix and the appendiceal orifice as well.  This was biopsied, and pathologic review revealed a small focus of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in the setting of an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
Given this finding, Mrs. Hildreth proceeded to the operating room on September 2, 2010, and underwent a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy with side-to-side ileotransverse colostomy under the care of Dr. Bryant and his team.  The preliminary pathology results from this resection have revealed a T2, N0 adenocarcinoma of the appendix.
Mrs. Hildreth states that she is doing relatively well postoperatively.  She does have some abdominal pain and has yet to pass flatus or stool.  She also has had some nausea but denies fevers, hills, cough, shortness-of-breath, or any other complaint.
