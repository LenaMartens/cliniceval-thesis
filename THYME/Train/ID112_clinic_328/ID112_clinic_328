#1 Sigmoid cancer
This disease was diagnosed in January 2010 and so far has not yet been treated.  The primary lesion in the sigmoid is biopsy-proven.  Imaging with a CT-scan shows a-1.6-cm lesion in the liver.  This is most likely a metastasis, although obviously not proven.  I discussed with Dr. Raymond the different approaches to his condition.  He understands that there is a strong likelihood that he has metastatic disease, although this is not proven.  One possible approach would be to schedule a surgical procedure to remove the primary tumor and during that procedure address the liver lesion.  The liver lesion could be removed along with the primary tumor.  Dr. Raymond understands that adjuvant therapy is indicated in any case.  This would consist of the combination of FOLFOX with or without Avastin.  We discussed the potential benefits and side-effects of such chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting, weakness, alopecia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, cold intolerance, and loss of taste as well as immune suppression.  We discussed at length whether it would be necessary to obtain a biopsy and/or a PET scan prior to a procedure.  I told him that it would probably be feasible to address the liver lesion during the time of surgery.  I have scheduled him with Drs. Robinson from Colorectal Surgery and Jone from Liver Surgery on Monday to further assess the situation.  I also explained to him that adjuvant therapy could be started no earlier than four weeks after surgery.
#2 Question of inflammatory bowel disease
Dr. Heron symptoms as well as the  findings on the CT-scan certainly are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.  However, biopsies of the affected part of the colon did not reveal any conclusive results.  The presence of IBD, however, would certainly help to explain Dr. Raymond's early-onset of this disease.

Dr. Raymond is a 47-year-old obstetrician from Loretto, Minnesota, who over the past three years experienced diarrhea.  Additionally, over the past two-to-three months he experienced pain in both of his testicles.  He has occasional hematochezia and has lost 20 pounds over the past year.  He states that this was intentional.  Medical workup here at the Lake Center included a colonoscopy on January 21, 2010, that was a suboptimal prep and only 25% of the mucosa could be visualized.  Beyond that there was melanosis coli in the right colon.  Beginning at the splenic flexure, the mucosa had an edematous boggy appearance according to the operative report.  Twenty to twenty-five cm from the anal verge a large polypoid lesion was encountered.  Biopsy of this lesion revealed adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemistry for microsatellite instability was performed, and no abnormalities were found.  A CT-scan on January 28, 2010, showed marked circumferential thickening of the distal colonic wall from the splenic flexure to the anus with inflammation and edema in the pericolonic fat and rectosigmoid mesentery.  There are fluid collections in the sigmoid mesentery as well as adenopathy that may be reactive or metastatic.  Also, a-1.6-cm hypodense mass in the posterolateral aspect of the right hepatic lobe in segment six can be seen.  A CEA was 32.4.
Dr. Raymond now comes to Saint Anthonys County Memorial Hospital to discuss further diagnostic workup and treatment.
