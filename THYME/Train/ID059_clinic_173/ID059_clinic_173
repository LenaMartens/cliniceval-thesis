#1 Ascending colonic adenocarcinoma, near obstructing
#2 Acute-on-chronic microcytic iron-deficiency anemia status-post 4 units of blood transfusion
#3 Multiple (`R` 10) low-attenuation hepatic masses concerning for metastases, largest 3 x 3-cm in size
#4 Large cystic left adnexal mass
#5 Hypertension
#6 Migraines
Ms. Gentry is a 43-year-old female with a history of microcytic anemia who was recently-diagnosed to have a colonic mass and was biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma.  Imaging has revealed metastases to the liver, as well as retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  In addition, an adnexal mass was noted.  Most recently she has had acute worsening of anemia and has required 4 units of blood transfusion.  She complains of intermittent dark stools.  We believe that she needs to undergo surgical resection before proceeding for chemotherapy because of the size of the lesion which is at high-risk for complete obstruction, as well as recent acute GI bleeding.   For the same, we will schedule a consultation with Dr. Smith.  In addition, we will also have her see Dr. Mefford in Medical Oncology which is scheduled for tomorrow morning.  We also discussed HNPCC, its work-up and its implications for family members.  She is interested in pursuing work-up for that.  To begin we will obtain IHC and MSI for DNA mismatch repair on the biopsy specimens from colonoscopy done on February 3.  If those are concerning then we will schedule consultation with our Medical Genetics department.
We will also schedule ovarian ultrasound for the large cystic adnexal mass.  Recent set of blood tests and chest x-ray have been done in anticipation of surgery.  I will revisit with Ms. Gentry along with our surgery colleagues tomorrow.

Ms. Gentry is a 43-year-old female who is a resident of Nisula and was admitted to the GI-B Service at Vielmetti Hospital a few weeks ago where I saw her.  She was admitted for diarrhea, microcytic iron-deficiency anemia, and questionable GI bleeding.  During her hospitalization an EGD was done which was unremarkable.  She was set-up for an outpatient colonoscopy.  The colonoscopy revealed large ascending colonic mass which was confirmed with biopsy as invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  During her hospitalization she dropped her hemoglobin to 6.9 and was transfused 4 units of blood.  She has been on iron supplements and has been having intermittent dark stools, but no frank hematochezia.  She has no family history of first or second-degree relatives with colon cancer.  A third-degree relative was diagnosed with colon cancer at more than 50 years of age.  No history of ovarian or breast cancer.  She has three children of ages 21, 20, and 19.  She denies weight-loss.  She denies fevers or chills.
She was seen by Dr. Cuneo this morning and underwent a CT abdomen and pelvis for staging purposes.  The CT-scan revealed multiple hepatic low-attenuation lesions in both hepatic lobes, as well as in the caudate lobe worrisome for metastases.  The one in the caudate lobe was largest and 3.3 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in size.  Single enlarged retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy about 1-cm in size, and a 6-mm node in the right lower quadrant was seen.  In addition, the large colonic mass about 7.1 x 7.7 x 9.1 cm was seen in the ascending colon.  There was also a large left adnexal cystic mass measuring 5.4 x 4.8 x 6.3 cm in size.
She denies any fever, chills or bowel obstructive symptoms.
