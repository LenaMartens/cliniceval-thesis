#1 Stage III, T2, N1, resected, upper rectal cancer
I discussed with the patient, also with Dr. Sumrall, that currently because he has stage III disease, we do recommend adjuvant chemoradiation therapy.  Standard therapy would include probably about two-months of FOLFOX with 5-FU bolus for four treatments, then followed by concurrent chemoradiation with 5-FU and radiation for about a month, then afterward with FOLFOX for about another two-months.  Post-radiation, there may be more toxicity, and then the 5-FU bolus could be omitted, if needed.  I explained this.  I explained side-effects associated with chemo, in general, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, GI side-effects as well as hand/foot rashes and numbness and tingling in the fingers/hands and cold sensitivity.  Patient expressed a wish to be treated at-home because he is living five hours away.  I asked him to get connected with a local oncologist soon because he is about a month after the surgery right now.  I told him the adjuvant chemoradiation usually started within about four to eight weeks after the surgery.  The patient also wanted to get radiation administered at-home.  I talked to him that I would recommend to him to talk to our radiation oncologists to get an opinion about side-effects and benefits.  He is willing to consider.

Mr. Gore is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman coming from Toledo, Ohio, for follow-up after resected rectal cancer for further therapy.  Mr. Gore's wife had rectal cancer diagnosed last year after a routine colonoscopy screen.  She had surgery done at BH.  Mr. Gore had a screening colonoscopy performed on April 12, 2010, and was found to have a lesion approximately 14 to 16 cm above the anal verge per outside report.  The lesion was biopsied and consistent with invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  A local CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, revealing thickening and inflammation in the distal sigmoid colon, consistent with this malignancy.  There was no lymphadenopathy identified in the CT-scan.  He had a small low-density lesion in the right hepatic lobe.  CEA performed at the time was 2.8.  Subsequently, he had further evaluation with MRI of the liver as well as ultrasound of the liver.  This lesion in the liver was read as not likely to be metastasis.  Therefore on April 29, 2010, he underwent a low-anterior resection of this upper rectal cancer.  Of note, he had proctoscopy performed here by Dr. Winland, and during the proctoscopy, the tumor was determined to be about 11 to 12-cm above the anal verge in the upper third of the rectum.  Postoperatively, the pathology came back showing grade 3 (of 4), moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumor size was about 3.4 cm.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  There was fat necrosis.  There was 1 (of 30) regional lymph node dissected that was positive for metastatic cancer.  Therefore the tumor was staged as T2, N1, stage III rectal cancer.  Since the surgery, the patient has recovered well.  He just complains there was a little bit of urgency with bowel movements during the day, probably about four to five times.  Otherwise, he is doing well and denies any bloody stool.  Denies any nausea, vomiting.  No abdominal discomfort.  He is eating very well.
