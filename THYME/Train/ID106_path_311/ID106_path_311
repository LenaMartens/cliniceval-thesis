Final Diagnosis
A.  Bladder, wall margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

B.  Bladder, wall margin No. 2, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

C.  Lymph node, omentum, lymphadenectomy:  A single omental lymph node is negative for tumor.

D.  Rectum and perirectal mass, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, clinically recurrent, consistent with colorectal origin forming a 4.2 x 3.2 x 2.2 cm perirectal mass.  The tumor is involving seminal vesicle and adventitia of the colonic wall.  Rectal mucosa is unremarkable.  The tumor extends to the deep soft tissue and bladder margins. Multiple (7) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. 

E.  Rectum, lateral margin piriformis, biopsy:  Focally positive for adenocarcinoma.

F.  Rectum, seminal vesicle margin, biopsy:  Seminal vesicle, negative for tumor.

G.  Bladder, anterior muscle margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor. 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""bladder wall margin"" is a 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm portion of red-tan soft tissue without orientation.  Margin all submitted.  Grossed by GAGNON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""bladder wall margin #2"" is a 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm portion of red-tan tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by GAGNON.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""omental lymph node"" is a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm lymph node.  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by GAGNON.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and perirectal mass"" is a 13.0 cm portion of colon and anus with a previous intact anastomosis site, and attached right soft tissue (6.2 x 4.0 x 3.0).  Sectioning reveals a 4.2 x 3.2 x 2.2 yellow-white, firm, right soft tissue mass located proximal to the anastomosis site which is focally adherent to the colon wall and invading attached seminal vesicles.  The mass extends to the deep and bladder margins.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue. Representative sections submitted.   Grossed by BARNEY.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""lateral margin"" are multiple (3) fibroadipose tissues ranging from 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm to 4.6 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm with orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by BARNEY.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""seminal vesicle margin"" is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.6 portion of seminal vesicle without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by BARNEY.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""anterior margin bladder muscle"" is a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm portion of red fibrous soft tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by BARNEY.




Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Ms. Robbin Holcomb CNP, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded perirectal mass adenocarcinoma, consistent with colorectal origin (block D8).  Upon completion, results will be available in URIZ ZjcpMtof.


Internal Comments
3/16/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for k-ras mutation analysis at request of Billy Martinez, CNP/aliff
