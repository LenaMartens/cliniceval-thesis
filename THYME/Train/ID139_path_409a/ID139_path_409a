Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (3.4 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm) located in the rectum, 1.4 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (17) diverticula are also identified in the sigmoid colon.  Multiple (5 of 41) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable bowel mucosa identified grossly.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2Mx].

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
