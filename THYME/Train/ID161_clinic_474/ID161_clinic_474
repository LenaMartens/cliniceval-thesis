DATA
Discussed above.
IMPRESSION/PLAN
#1 Hepatic flexure colon mass
This is concerning clinically for a malignancy although we do not have pathologic evidence.  Dr. Carey Stein has reviewed the information regarding Mr. Ralston and would like us to proceed with a colonoscopy with biopsy of the lesion and a staging CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  We will get a CEA as well.  Discussed likely surgery being a right hemicolectomy versus an extended right hemicolectomy depending on the location of the mass.  Also discussed if this is found to be a malignancy that based on the surgical pathology he may need additional treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy.  With his early-onset of likely colon cancer, I discussed with him the potential for testing for HNPCC (Lynch syndrome) and gave him a pamphlet on MSI/IHC testing as well as the HNPCC pamphlet.  After discussing the IHC/MSI testing as initial screening tests with Mr. Ralston and his sister, Dr. Stahl, he would like to go ahead and proceed.  If this is found to be a malignancy on biopsy, we can proceed with this and hopefully have the IHC results back by Monday when he sees Dr. Stein.  We will tentatively plan for surgery next week depending on his evaluation.  I discussed with him all of his sisters should have colonoscopies if they have not done so, and at this time he does not have children.   I discussed with him to stop taking  ibuprofen and instead if he has discomfort to use Tylenol because of his bleeding.
#2 Hypertension
Well-controlled.  Recent adjustment in medications.
#3 Anemia likely related to No. 1
Will get type and screen as well as CBC.
#4 Hyperlipidemia
Well-controlled.
#5 Obesity
#6 PAME
Will get a baseline EKG with his early family history of heart disease with his father as well as his risk factors including obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  Otherwise he is generally active.  Unless this is abnormal, I do not feel a stress test is indicated.
He was seen with his sister.  All questions were answered.  Sixty minutes spent.  Given laparoscopic colon book.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
Code status:  Discussed with Mr. Ralston, and he would like to be a full code.

Mr. Ralston is a 48-year-old male from 53912, who is the brother of Dr. Lee Stahl in Pathology here at JSEIMC.  Mr. Ralston went in for his annual physical and had discussed with his local provider that for the last five to six-months he has been having intermittent rectal bleeding.  He noticed his stools were "reddish."  This did not happen very often, just a few times a month.  He also noticed that his stools became a little more loose although they were not diarrhea.  He was still going two-to-three times a day which was his norm.  He denies fecal incontinence.  He had blood work performed as part of his evaluation which revealed a hemoglobin of 10.2 with a hematocrit of 33.8 on April 12, 2010.  His hemoglobin was suspected to be normal approximately a year ago.  He had never had colon screening and has no family history of colon cancer but proceeded to a colonoscopy locally on April 20, 2010 revealing a circumferential mass at the hepatic flexure.  The endoscope was not able to be passed beyond this.  This appeared "frankly malignant."  SPOT injection was used to mark the area.  He also had a small transverse colon polyp that was removed with a cold snare.  They did not biopsy the hepatic flexure lesion.  We also do not have pathology from the other small transverse colon polyp.  He has not undergone further evaluation and is here for definitive treatment.
Mr. Ralston also had noticed "a pressure sensation" in the low pelvis and a little more gas pain.  He would not call this pain.  He had also had intermittent problems prior to going in for evaluation with anal pain with defecation rating a 6 on the pain scale and then he would be sore for several hours afterward.  He does not remember being constipated.  He thought initially that this was where the bleeding was coming from and that maybe he had a tear at the anus.  His appetite has been good although he has lost 10 to 15 pounds intentionally over the last six-months with doing more walking, exercising, and watching his diet.  He denies recent nausea or vomiting.  He has not felt more fatigued and works as an IT specialist.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Hepatic flexure colon mass.  Discussed above.
2.  Hypertension.  He has been on medication for approximately five years.  About a week ago they decreased his Benicar as his blood pressure was on the lower side.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  His cholesterol was just checked with his physical on April 12, 2010.  Cholesterol was 125, triglycerides IL, HDL 41, and LDL 74.
4.  Anemia likely secondary to No. 1.  Discussed above.  He had iron studies performed locally on April 12, 2010.  Iron level was 26, total iron-binding capacity was normal, with only 7% transferrin saturation.
5.  Obesity.  He has been working on weight-loss.
6.  Partial tear of the posterior collateral ligament of the left knee.  He underwent just physical therapy, and surgery was not recommended.  He does not feel this is 100%, but he is doing okay with it at this time.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Appendectomy in the 1990s.
2.  LASIK surgery bilaterally.
