Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, ascending, right hemicolectomy:  Microscopic foci of residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma are identified within an ulcerated biopsy site, 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm, in the ascending colon, situated 7.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades the submucosa.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (38) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled right colon is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 2.0 cm of terminal ileum, 16.0 cm of colon, and a 6.5 x 0.6 cm appendix.  Two separate ulcerative lesions  (1.1 x 0.8 cm, and 0.5 x 0.4 cm) are present within the ascending colon, 7.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The ulcers are 0.5 cm apart.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The ulcer is 4.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BURTON.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, ascending, right hemicolectomy:  Suspicious for microscopic residual carcinoma  in submucosa below the biopsy site.  Hold over to further evaluate.
