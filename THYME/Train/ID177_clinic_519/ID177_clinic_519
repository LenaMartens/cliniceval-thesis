#1 Metastatic sigmoid cancer, KRAS wild type, BRAS wild type with liver metastasis.
Plan is to resect the primary (sigmoid tumor) by Jean Ayers, and debulk disease in the liver (by Jean Ayers)
28-Jul-2010 12:48:00  F-18 FDG PET/CT-scan was performed from the orbits through the upper thighs with CT fusion imaging for attenuation correction and anatomic coregistration only. Clinical Indication: Colon cancer restaging. Subsequent treatment strategy. Impression: Probable persistent disease in the sigmoid colon although there is evidence for therapeutic response. No metabolically viable metastasis. Findings: A large sigmoid lesion identified on outside CTs from March, 2010 is smaller in size on today's examination. The abnormality demonstrates moderately elevated metabolism with an SUV max of 5.1. This should represent residual malignancy although the size change would suggest some interval response to therapy. No PET scan prior to therapy is available for comparison. Previously described hepatic metastasis have resolved and no regions in the liver are hypermetabolic suggesting therapeutic response. Moderately hypermetabolic cecal uptake is likely physiologic. No other areas of increased uptake of concern are identified. Other physiologic activity is identified. Significant incidental findings on the low-dose unenhanced CT fusion images. See dedicated CT data from today. Calcified mediastinal adenopathy. Central venous catheter.
28-Jul-2010 15:01:00  CT-scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast: COMPARISON: Outside CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast 3/11/2010. CONCLUSION/IMPRESSION:
1. Interval resolution of hepatic metastases.
2. Decreased size of distal sigmoid carcinoma and perisigmoid metastases.
FINDINGS: Atelectasis or scarring in both lung bases anteriorly is unchanged. Two regions of increased hepatic enhancement are unchanged and should be benign. Hepatic metastases have resolved. Moderate
aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Calcified left para-aortic lymph nodes. Distal perisigmoid soft-tissue masses have resolved almost completely. Distal sigmoid mural thickening has decreased from severe to moderate.
Left colonic diverticulosis. Small hiatal hernia. Benign sacral bone island. Abdomen and pelvis are otherwise unremarkable.
29Jul2010 17:20 ECG: VENTRICULAR RATE 51. Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise normal ECG. No previous ECGs available.
Admission  labs:
Hgb 12.3    WBC 3.9     PLT  142    Na 136     K   4.0   CR  0.8    ALK-Phos  71     AST 31    Bili (total/direct)  0.6/0.2      INR   1.1  CEA  4.8    Blood type  A-positive

Per Dr Strange's note dated 7-29-2010:
Mrs. Tolbert is a very pleasant 66-year-old patient who has been referred to Medical Oncology by Dr. Cook to obtain an opinion regarding the future management of her metastatic colon cancer.
The patient underwent a routine colonoscopy on March 11, 2010, and was found to have a mass in the sigmoid.  Biopsies confirmed the presence of an adenocarcinoma.  The same-day a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which revealed multiple intrahepatic metastases.  The CEA was 145.  Subsequently the patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab.  After four cycles a CT-scan revealed an excellent response with almost complete resolution of the intrahepatic lesions and good response of the primary tumor to chemotherapy.
The patient consulted Nanticoke Valley Memorial Hospital in June of 2010.  At that time our recommendation as to hold bevacizumab, continue chemotherapy with modified cycles of FOLFOX and then bring the patient back with a CT-scan of abdomen, pelvis and PET CT-scan for surgical evaluation.
Mrs. Tolbert now returns to Nanticoke Valley Memorial Hospital after she has stopped Avastin about eight weeks ago and has received one more cycle of FOLFOX.  She has been tolerating the treatment very well, although the last treatment cycle which was her seventh cycle of oxaliplatin resulted in more prolonged sensorineural toxicity, in particular cold sensitivity.  Otherwise she is doing fine, she is motivated to move forward with the surgical approach. She is currently on low-molecular-weight heparin and has stopped her Coumadin about a week ago.
