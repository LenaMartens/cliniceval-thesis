#1 Resected recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Dawn Divers's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Doug Martin, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
As outlined by Mr. Haynes's primary oncologist at Maplewood Manor Personal Home, Dr. Alderson, adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended.  Mr. Haynes is planning on returning to New York, receiving care under his local medical oncologist, therefore, I will not make follow-up appointments for him to return in the outpatient setting.  We would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy.  A KRAS status has been ordered and is currently pending.  When available, the results will be notified to Dr. Alderson and then passed on to his local medical oncologist in New York.  I have indicated to Mr. Haynes that if any problems or concerns arise at any time, I am more than happy to help facilitate care.

I have been asked by Dr. Edwards service to visit with Mr. Haynes for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Haynes is a very pleasant 40-year-old male from New York.
1.  Summer 2006 - Developed tenesmus and bright-red blood per rectum.  Evaluated locally.
2.  November 2006 - Evaluated locally with endoscopic rectal ultrasound showing a rectal carcinoma at 10-cm from the anal verge extending over five cm in length, characterized as a T3 lesion.
3.  November 28, 2006-January 10, 2007 - Underwent radiation and 5FU with Leucovorin continuous infusion for a total of 25 fractions for a total of 4500 cGy with a boost of 540 cGy in three sessions to the rectum.
4.  March 5, 2007 - Underwent surgical resection.  Five regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma.
5.  Spring 2007-August 2007 - Underwent FOLFOX with oxaliplatin, dropped after eight cycles of treatment.  Overall, tolerated well.  Had thrombotic event with a left internal jugular, left subclavian, and axillary veins related to port-a-cath.
6.  November 2009 - Routine CT-scan showing a mass lesion to the right of the pelvis adjacent to the bladder with concern of infiltration into the seminal vesicle.  Biopsies confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a rectal primary.
7.  February 2010 - Referred to Maplewood Manor Personal Home.  Evaluated by Dr. Dale Hill, Radiation Oncology, Dr. Dawn Divers of General Surgery, and Dr. Jesse Alderson Greil University of Iowa Hospital Clinics.  Consensus to have patient undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery and IORT.
8.  February 17, 2010-March 10, 2010 - Underwent external-beam radiation for a total of 30 Gy and 15 fraction with concurrent Xeloda therapy.  Overall, tolerated reasonably well.
9.  March 11, 2010 - Underwent surgical resection of the rectum, perirectal area with intraoperative radiation.  Per operative note, the tumor was quite stuck along the obturator area and the piriformis.  Margins along the seminal vesicle area are positive as well as the pelvic side wall and an additional seminal vesicle was removed.  All margins negative except for one microscopic area that was boosted with intraoperative radiation treatment.  Surgical pathology from the rectum and perirectal mass resection noting grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin forming a 4.2 x 3.2 x 2.2-cm perirectal mass involving the seminal vesicle and adventitia of the colonic wall.   Tumor extended to the deep soft-tissue and bladder margins.  Seven regional lymph nodes negative for tumor.  Lateral margin of the pyriformis area focally positive for adenocarcinoma.  Single omental lymph node-negative for tumor.
Mr. Haynes is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
