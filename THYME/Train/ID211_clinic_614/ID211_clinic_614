#1 Metastatic colon cancer to the pelvis with a history of breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and tongue cancer
Mrs. Cason is a very pleasant 47-year-old female with a complicated prior past medical history seeking treatment recommendations for her metastatic colon cancer.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Sidney Moritz through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.

Mrs. Cason is a very pleasant 47-year-old female from Rhode Island.  She has a prior past medical history significant for a Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in 1983 in her left neck and mediastinum treated with MOPP and ABVD chemotherapy.  She subsequently had a recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1987 in the left supraclavicular area and had an additional six cycles of MOPP chemotherapy.  She also had the recurrence in the left supraclavicular fossa and mediastinum treated with mantle radiation which included her axilla.  She received a total dose of 3960 cGy.
1.  April 2007, presented for a general medical exam including mammogram.  This identified a breast cancer treated with lumpectomy to the left breast, Nottingham grade III (of III).  Negative for ER, PR, and HER-2/neu.  High-proliferation index on MBI-1 stain.  Was a ductal carcinoma with negative surgical margin.  Subsequently initiated treatment with chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin and an additional chemotherapy drug (details unclear).  After three cycles of treatment, developed bright-red blood per rectum.
2.  August 2007, developed left-sided pelvic pain.  Subsequent CT imaging showing bilobular liver lesions (at least 6) and a rectosigmoid mass.
3.  September 2007 to November 2007, initiated FOLFOX plus Vectibix (chemotherapy for breast cancer stopped).  Overall tolerated well.
4.  February 2008, underwent rectosigmoid resection and partial hepatectomy.  Surgical pathology showing a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 1.1-cm in size.  Staged at a T3, N1 (2 [of 22]) with 80% viable tumor.  Also liver segment III consisted of adenocarcinoma 40% viable tumor, segment IV no viable tumor, segment V adenocarcinoma with 30% viable tumor.
5.  February 2008 to April 2008, no evidence of disease recurrence.
6.  April 2008, CT imaging done for follow-up purposes showing suspicious lymph nodes in the pelvis.  No other evidence of disease.
7.  April 2008 to September 2008, initiated on FOLFIRI.  Overall tolerated well, although did have diarrhea and alopecia.
8.  November 2008, CT imaging showing decreasing size of lymph nodes.  Observation pursued.  No treatment given.
9.  November 2008 to November 2009, no evidence of disease recurrence.
10.  November 2009, PET/CT-scan done after increasing CEA.  Increased FDG activity in the right soft palate, right jugular and angle mandibula, as well as two left pelvic lymph nodes adjacent to the anastomotic site.  Biopsies obtained of the lymph nodes in the neck consistent with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, staged at T2, N1.
11.  November 2009 to January 2010, given cisplatin and Taxotere times 16 weekly cycles to treat newly-diagnosed tongue cancer.
12.  February 2010, PET/CT-scan showing resolution on the right-side of the tongue/neck region but worsening FDG uptake in the lymph nodes in the pelvis.
13.  April 2010, underwent pelvic lymph node dissection for a 3-cm tumor consistent with recurrent colon cancer.  Positive inked margin.  PET/CT-scan showing two FDG-avid areas in the left presacral space concerning for recurrent colon cancer.
14.  May 2010 to June 29, 2010, received pelvic radiation to lymph nodes and the left presacral space for a total dose of 5400 cGy.
15.  April 2010 to June 2010, concurrently received external-beam radiation treatments with concurrent Xeloda to the tongue for a total of 4500 cGy.
16.  June 7, 2010, received brachytherapy to the tongue.  Also had a trach placed, subsequently removed.
17.  August  2010, PET/CT-scan showing improved FDG uptake in the pelvic lymph nodes.  No other evidence of disease.  Referred to the Backus Hospital of Maine to discuss possible pelvic exenteration and/or intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy.
Presently, overall, Mrs. Cason notes she is essentially asymptomatic and doing extremely well.  She does have residual neuropathy in her hands and her feet from her prior oxaliplatin exposure.  The neuropathy in her feet does extend to above her ankles.  Overall, her appetite is diminished due to a change in her taste buds since her radiation to her head and neck, but she has able to maintain her weight, although she did lose 25 pounds going through her radiation treatments.  She denies any pain, specifically no pelvic, abdominal, neck, or throat pain.  She has no problems with urination.  She has a bowel movement once or twice-a-day which are typically formed.  No evidence of blood or mucus, diarrhea, or constipation.  She has a good energy level and is very active, but she is retired for being an executive assistant.  She has no nausea or vomiting.  She has no fevers or drenching night sweats.  She has no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.
