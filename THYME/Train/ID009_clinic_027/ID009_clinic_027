Mr. Higginbotham has had resection of a grade 3 adenocarcinoma of the splenic flexure with involvement of 2 (of 44) regional lymph nodes.  I discussed these findings with him and his son, particularly with regard to the question of adjuvant chemotherapy.  I am concerned about use of adjuvant chemotherapy such as FOLFOX in this elderly man.  He already has some moderately-severe neuropathy with a lot of difficulty walking, and I do not think he is a candidate for any regimen using drugs such as oxaliplatin.  We discussed the use of multiple cycles of capecitabine, but I think even this has the possibility/probability of some significant toxicity with a relatively low increment of improvement in outlook.  All-in-all, I think adjuvant chemotherapy for this man carries some significant risks, not only to his overall health but also to his quality of life with minimal improvement in his risk of recurrent disease.  I think the best approach is observation at intervals.  He does have a schedule to be seen by his physicians, but at this point, I do not think there is a good argument for adjuvant chemotherapy in this man.

Mr. Higginbotham is a 76-year-old man who has some significant comorbidities and was found recently to have an adenocarcinoma of the colon.  He has a history of having had prostate cancer back in 2002, and Gleason 3 + 3 adenocarcinoma for which he received 7200 cGy in 40 treatment fractions, finishing this therapy back in March of 2003.  This was treatment delivered in AR by Dr. Leslie Delafuente.  In January of this year, he had an episode of right-sided weakness.  He was evaluated in Newark and subsequently evaluated at the Emergency Room here at Hampton and Gynecology Center.  He was hospitalized on the Neurology Service for several days for what appeared to be a left middle cerebral artery multiinfarct stroke.  This was thought to be related to his hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus.  He has had improvement in his ambulation, though he still walks with a walker.  He also has some paresthesias in his feet thought to be related to his diabetes.  In March, he underwent a left hemicolectomy for an adenocarcinoma, grade 3, of the colon.  The margins were negative, though close, and there was no evidence of vascular invasion.  He did have 2 (of 44) regional lymph nodes involved with metastatic disease.  He has recovered slowly since then but seems to be improving.  He lives by himself, though he does have a girlfriend who is frequently with him.
He states that he has recently had some problems with his bowel movements with a lot of straining to pass his stools.  This has improved since he has been using high-fiber cereals along with some stool softeners.  He was seen in the emergency room in Newark not long ago, and apparently, there was some thought that he had urinary retention.  He had a catheter placed at that time which was very uncomfortable.  After several days, he felt that he could not stand it any longer and cut the catheter and then removed it.  He states that he had some blood in his urine for a time, but this is now clear.  He feels that he empties his bladder reasonably well.  He does not have a history of urinary tract infections.
