#1 Positive paravaginal mass
#2 History of grade 1 endometrial cancer treated in 2005
For exploration tomorrow, we will begin in synchronous position and do some vaginal biopsies to be sure there is no mucosal disease and then proceed with midline and dissection of the paravaginal mass with resection.  Listed as such, possible bowel resection, possible portion of bladder resection.  However, this is a localized lesion.  I did not anticipate a major debulking operation.  Discussed with the patient and her husband.  Reviewed all risks, benefits, and alternatives.  Patient signed consent in clinic today.  She should not need site marking as this procedure list is excision of a mass.  All questions answered.

Seventy-five-year-old G1 whom I asked to see for evaluation of a pelvic mass.  I operated on Mrs. Taylor in 2005 in April for what was cervical dysplasia and a very early grade 1 endometrial carcinoma in a background of atypical hyperplasia.  She had a-1.7-cm lesion with less than 2-mm of invasion.  The only high-risk factor was positive cytology; however, she had a-D&C and conization just immediately preoperatively so this was thought to be an incidental notation and not a high-risk factor.  She received no adjuvant treatment and underwent TAHBSO without staging biopsies given the size and the grade of the lesion.  She had an accident with a motor-vehicle in November of 2009, and this has resulted in some pain and most likely musculoskeletal but in the evaluation, CT scans were done including an MRI and CT in February.  There was some nodularity noted above the vaginal cuff, particularly on the right, and thought to be postop in nature.  However, a recent PET scan was done which showed this was PET positive.  Interestingly, she also had some PET-positive changes along the anterior surface of the rectum, although on CT-scan this is negative as it is with MRI.  She has had recent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy finding of H. pylori with gastritis, and some random biopsies in the colonoscopy were done and are pending.
SUBSEQUENT VISIT 5/6/10:
See my last note dated April 22 for details.  The patient has since no interval symptoms.  A colposcopy and upper endoscopy were essentially negative, except for gastritis.  Biopsies were negative.  She is ready for surgery tomorrow.  In the interim, I did discuss by phone with Dr. Kittie Payne here at MGMC from Radiation Oncology, and she agreed with the plan.
