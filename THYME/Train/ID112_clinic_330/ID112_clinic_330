#1 pT3, N1, M1, completely resected adenocarcinoma of the distal sigmoid
This disease was completely resected by Dr. Robinson on February 4, 2010.  Although therapy for rectal cancer was discussed, it apparently was decided not to give chemoradiation therapy because of known systemic involvement.  Dr. Sullivan has tolerated the chemotherapy with irinotecan only poorly, likely because of a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene.  Also, Avastin had to be stopped after several doses because of deteriorating renal function.  Dr. Sullivan has discussed with his oncologist to continue the 5-FU/leucovorin for another 18 months.  I discussed with him that after completion of 12 cycles of adjuvant therapy, there is no evidence that further chemotherapy would be of any benefit nor is it defined for how long chemotherapy should be continued.  On the other hand, In Dr. Sullivan's case, only a small part of the planned chemotherapy was given and he himself is quite conflicted whether he should continue with the 5-FU/leucovorin only.  He understands that there is currently no data that points in either direction based on evidence.  We have discussed again that since his tumor is KRAS wild-type, he would be eligible for treatment with cetuximab, should a recurrence happen.  He briefly asked whether BRAF testing would be indicated, and I explained that BRAF mutations have no predictive value with regard to cetuximab sensitivity.
#2 Subtle irregularity in the bile ducts
This is a finding seen on the most recent MRI of the abdomen.  I discussed this finding with Dr. Glen Garner from Radiology.  He stated that this is only seen on one series and that he therefore would not be particularly concerned.  The main reason he had mentioned this was because of a questionable history of inflammatory bowel disease and, in the setting, Dr. Sullivan might have an increased risk for sclerosing cholangitis.  Although initially the macroscopic findings during colonoscopy and CT scanning had indicated the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, the pathology report from the colectomy does not describe any evidence for this.  Therefore we felt that it is reasonable to follow-up in three-months with a repeat MRI integrating an MRCP into this examination.  Dr. Burns assessment greatly reassured Dr. Sullivan, and we will follow this up three-months from now.
#3 Congenital single kidney
This is the main reason for Dr. Arana impaired renal function.  Another contributing factor is diabetes.  He will therefore not be able to receive any more CT scans that require contrast.
I discussed with Dr. Sullivan that he should follow-up in three-months with a repeat MRI.  At that time, I will see him back in my clinic and discuss further approach to therapy.  We again discussed at length that continuing therapy in the face of no evidence of disease is not a proven approach.  It is currently being studied in clinical trials.

Dr. Sullivan is a 48-year-old obstetrician from Loretto, Minnesota, who has had a pT3, N1, M1 adenocarcinoma 11.5 cm from the anal verge, resected on February 4, 2010.  At the same time, a single liver metastasis in segment VI was resected.  I have not seen Dr. Sullivan since his surgery.  He underwent adjuvant therapy with FOLFIRI plus Avastin.  This combination was chosen because Dr. Sullivan is a surgeon himself and was anxious about peripheral neuropathy.  Unfortunately, Dr. Sullivan tolerated the irinotecan only poorly.  He has a polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene.  His dose was therefore reduced by 50%, but he still tolerated it only poorly.  After nine cycles, the irinotecan was omitted from the regimen.  Since then, he has had two more doses of 5-FU/leucovorin only.  He will complete this for a total of 12 cycles.
Dr. Sullivan reports significant fatigue even with the 5-FU alone.  He denies diarrhea, but his main problem is a "bad taste" in the mouth as well as nasal ulcers.  He did notice a small area of numbness and tingling on the back of his left-hand about a month ago.  This has not become worse or better since then.
An MRI of the abdomen performed on August 5, 2010, did not show any evidence of recurrence of disease.  The reports describes a subtle irregularity of the common bile duct only on series 2.  A CT-scan of the chest without contrast did not reveal any abnormalities.  CBC and chemistry are within acceptable limits.  CEA is 2.0.
