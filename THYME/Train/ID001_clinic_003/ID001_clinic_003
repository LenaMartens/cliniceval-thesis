#1 Stage III (T3, N1, M0) colon adenocarcinoma
Miss Mullins is recovering reasonably well after her surgery for stage III colon adenocarcinoma.  I reviewed at length with Ms. Mullins and her sister-in-law the results of the pathology from her surgery and the fact that there is a significant risk for tumor recurrence.  I reviewed with her information from Adjuvant! Online suggesting that for someone her age there might be a 5% mortality benefit derived from 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.  We also discussed some of the toxicities of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.  She is not interested in pursuing chemotherapy at this time but is interested in continued surveillance, as a recurrence might be amenable to a focal therapy such as radiofrequency ablation.  I will plan to follow her up in approximately four months with a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a CEA and will proceed from there.  She is welcome to call me in the interim if she has any new symptoms or concerns.

1.  February 2010--developed constipation for several days and bright-red blood per rectum.  Presented to Reynolds Center Emergency Department where she was found to have a hemoglobin of 6.8.  She was admitted for inpatient workup.  EGD February 18, 2010, showed achalasia.  Colonoscopy February 18, 2010, showed a large cecal mass.  This was biopsied and shown to be grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed multiple hypodense liver lesions; however, ultrasound showed these to be cystic in nature.
2.  February 24, 2010--underwent right hemicolectomy by Dr. Wadsworth.  Pathology showed a 6.8- x 6.3- x 1.6-cm mass.  Histology was grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Mass involved the cecum and ileocecal valve.  Two (of 33) lymph nodes were involved with adenocarcinoma.  Postoperative recovery was uneventful.
Miss Mullins and her sister-in-law present for evaluation of colon adenocarcinoma.  She is recovering reasonably well from her surgery of about six-weeks ago.  She feels slightly weak but has resumed most of her normal activities.  She does note darkness of the stools and on two-to-three incidents has had a slight amount of blood in the stools since her surgery.  Other than this, she is feeling reasonably well.  She has not noted any new areas of pain and has had no fevers or other signs of infection.  Has no diarrhea and no new lumps or masses.  Performance status is 1.
