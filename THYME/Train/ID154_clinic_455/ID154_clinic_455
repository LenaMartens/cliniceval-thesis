She returns to Medical Oncology doing well.  I discussed the concept of adjuvant therapy and suggested that she have four months of treatment.  It is unclear what the best regimen would be.  She previously had treatment with oxaliplatin and irinotecan with Erbitux added and had only a moderate response.  She did much better with the Xeloda with radiation therapy.  As adjuvant treatment, she could consider FOLFOX for four months (eight cycles) or could also consider perhaps treatment with Xeloda.  She will get this in Niwot.  After her adjuvant therapy, she hopes to have an ileostomy takedown.
I hope she does well with this treatment.  I am pleased at how well she has to this point.

Terry Cameron is 45 years old and lives in Niwot.
PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1.  December 2009, abdominal pain with bleeding from the rectum.  Colonoscopy performed and revealed a tumor in the sigmoid.
2.  December 14, 2009, exploratory laparotomy.  The tumor was stuck to other areas of bowel, colostomy was performed but there was no resection.
3.  Late January 2010, she started chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and irinotecan.  She received six cycles of this and eight cycles of Erbitux weekly once she was found to be KRAS wild type.
4.  She was investigated and found to have Lynch syndrome.  Her sister had uterine cancer and has Lynch syndrome.  Her mother did have colon cancer, but has not been proven to have Lynch syndrome.
5.  April 17, 2010, CT-scan done which showed some improvement in the tumor, but there was a fistula from the small-bowel to the colon.  Patient had noted that food entered the colostomy bag.
6.  Clot found in the left inguinal region, and patient started on Coumadin.
7.  The patient was recommended to start chemoradiation.  The patient received a total of 30 fractions of radiation therapy in Guatemala along with Xeloda, completed on July 1st, 2010.  The patient tolerated the therapy fairly well.
8.  August 17, 2010, patient returned to Saint Joseph Center and had resection of her colon carcinoma which had invaded into the small-bowel by Dr. Billy Gaines of Colon & Rectal Surgery.  There was residual tumor in the bowel, but nodes were negative.  In addition, she had a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

She wants the CT scans that were done here put on disk, and that is being taken care of.  This note also should be typed and put with the disk so that she can pick them up on Wednesday.
