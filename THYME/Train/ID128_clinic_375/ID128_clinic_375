#1 Sigmoid cancer
Mrs. Nance is a 42-year-old nurse who has noticed off-and-on rectal bleeding for a year, change in the caliber size of her stool for the last six-months.  On colonoscopy recently (I do not have the official report), was found to have a nonobstructing tumor lesion in the sigmoid colon which was at between 22 to 24 cm location.  Full colonoscopy was performed; some other small polyps or thought to be polyps were removed.  Pathology has been read here, and ascending colon polyp with tubular adenoma, low-grade dysplasia, midtransverse colon; splenic flexure polyp, tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia; transverse colon splenic flexure, normal colonic mucosa; sigmoid colon at 45 cm, normal colon mucosa with inflammatory reaction with mucus; sigmoid colon 40 cm, inflammatory reaction with mucus, normal colonic mucosa; sigmoid colon 35 cm, inflammatory reaction with mucus, normal colonic mucosa; 30 cm no tissue recovered; 25 cm, normal colonic mucosa, and finally between 20 and 23 cm, infiltrating grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma. Patient had essentially negative CT abdomen and pelvis 8 February 2010.  Patient now wishes to have surgery here.
