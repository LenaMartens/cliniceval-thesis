Mr. Mccormick underwent radical surgery in June of 2010 for his local tumor recurrence as well as the liver metastases.  He is still recovering from the aftermath of the surgery.  Unfortunately, I was not able to see the CT scans obtained today, but I do not anticipate any signs of early tumor recurrence.  The patient's tumor marker CEA is now normalized after surgery.
From my perspective, I would normally recommend an additional six cycles of modified FOLFOX6 as adjuvant therapy.  However, the patient is not in physical shape yet to start treatment.  If he can get back on his feet within the next four weeks, he might be a candidate for additional cycles of chemotherapy.  Otherwise, I would just watch the situation and follow the patient closely with scans every three-months for the first three years after the surgery.
Mr. Mccormick was content with the information received.  All questions were answered.

Mr. Mccormick is a very pleasant 41-year-old patient who was being referred to Los Angeles Medical Center at Peoples Memorial Hospital in March 2010 to obtain an opinion regarding the future management of his metastatic and recurrent colon cancer.  His oncologic history started in July of 2006 when he was diagnosed with a sigmoid cancer characterized as a multifocal, moderately differentiated colon cancer arising from a villous adenoma.  He underwent sigmoid resection.  Pathology confirmed a T2, N0 cancer with 11 lymph nodes resected, all of which were not involved with cancer.  In view of the stage I disease, no further adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.  Also, no genetic testing was performed.  It is of note that the patient has a twin brother who underwent colonoscopy and was found to have polyps.
During a follow-up CT-scan in November of 2009 a moderate left hydronephrosis and a small pelvic mass obstructing the left ureter was found.  In addition, a low-attenuation region in the right liver lobe was seen.  A PET/CT-scan confirmed tracer uptake in both of these areas.  Subsequently, the patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 and had received six cycles of therapy from December to February 17, 2010.  No bevacizumab was added.
We saw the patient in March 2010 to develop a strategy with regard to potential surgical management of these two areas of tumor recurrence.  In conjunction with Dr. Durham, Colorectal Surgery, and Dr. Newton, Radiation Oncology, we decided to continue the treatment with a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy approach toward the pelvic metastasis and then bring the patient back for potential surgery.
Subsequently, the patient received infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, plus radiation therapy to the pelvic recurrence, which was completed in late April of 2010.  Radiation was to a dose of 50.4 Gy.
On June 10, 2010, the patient underwent en bloc resection of the left periurethral recurrence of his cancer as well as a liver resection here at Peoples Memorial Hospital.  At the same time, intraoperative radiation therapy was performed.  Pathology confirmed the presence of a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with clear resection margins.
The postoperative course was complicated by a biloma which required a transthoracic drain placement as well as pain in the patient's left leg with left leg swelling and some weakness in the left leg, presumably due to a nerve injury during the surgery.
Mr. Mccormick now returns to Peoples Memorial Hospital for various appointments including CT imaging.  Upon presentation, he stated that he is still recovering from the surgery.  His mobility is reduced due to the complications related to his left leg.  He underwent a doppler ultrasound today without evidence of a blood clot.  Dr. Withrow in Urology tried to pull the left ureteral stent, but the patient could not tolerate the pain and this will be done under sedation tomorrow.  The patient also met with Dr. Banks
