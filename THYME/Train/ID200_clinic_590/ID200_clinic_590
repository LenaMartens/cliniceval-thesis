Mr. Damron is a pleasant 45-year-old male with resected perforated sigmoid adenocarcinoma seeking treatment recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.

I will staff this with Dr. Billy Sevilla through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent supervisory note.
