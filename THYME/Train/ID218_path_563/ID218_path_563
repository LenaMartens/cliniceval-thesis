Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, anus, and portion of vagina; abdominal perineal resection:  Residual moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 0.2 cm (in greatest dimension) nodule in the muscularis propria in a background of ulcer base and dense fibrosis and inflammation forming a mass (5.0 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm).  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  The vaginal mucosa is uninvolved.  Multiple (15) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in SNPC MtiiBomb.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum, anus, and portion of vagina"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 19.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 5.0 x 3.0 cm portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked.  A 5.0 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 1.0 cm from the dentate line, 1.5 cm from the anal mucosal margin, and 1.2 from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LINDSEY.



Addendum Diagnosis
Reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC cannot be performed because only microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma remain following neoadjuvant therapy.
