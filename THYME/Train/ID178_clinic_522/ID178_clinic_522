Ms. Seitz is a 39-year-old woman who underwent a sigmoid resection for a large polypoid lesion in her sigmoid.  She sent me a CEA drawn closer to home.  The CEA level is 0.5, well within normal limits.  Her final pathology here from her resection was a moderately invasive adenocarcinoma with focal high-grade dysplasia with all regional lymph nodes negative for tumor.  There were sixteen lymph nodes sampled.  We will continue to follow her with every three-months CEA.
