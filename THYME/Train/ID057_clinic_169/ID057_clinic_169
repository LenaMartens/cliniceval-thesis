#1 Stage IIA (T3N0M0) adenocarcinoma of the colon status-post right hemicolectomy
#2 Multifactorial dementia, including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct dementia
#3 Multiple medical comorbidities
Mrs. Prime is a very pleasant 84-year-old female with recently resected stage IIA colon cancer.  We spent a fair amount of time speaking with her and her son in regard to her diagnosis and our treatment recommendations at this time.  The patient was very sleepy, however, and most of the information was relayed to her son.  The first goal of care for her will be for her to recover from the surgery.  We would then like to see her back in clinic in about four to six-weeks' time.  More than likely, we will not recommend any chemotherapy treatment options for her, due to the stage and features of her resected disease and also for her current performance status.  However, we will fully address this issue when she comes back for follow-up.  She is from KS and will likely continue follow-up from that point forward back near home, but this will be decided when she returns to the GI Clinic in about a month.  We answered all the patient's and her son's questions to the best of our ability.
Thank-you for allowing us to consult in Mrs. Prime's care.  Please do not hesitate to call us with any questions; our pager is 743-97700.

Mrs. Prime is a very pleasant 84-year-old female whose oncologic history is as follows:
1.  April 9, 2010:  The patient presented to her local hospital and was treated for issues with a suspected GI bleed and anemia (hemoglobin of 7.3).  A barium enema study, six-months prior to this admission, was supposedly without any abnormalities.  It was a follow-up of a colonoscopy in 2005 that was reported to have required some follow-up this year.
2.  April 12, 2010:  The colonoscopy completed in that hospitalization, at the outside hospital, showed a-1-cm polyp near the appendix with pathology consistent with a tubular adenoma, and additionally, a right-sided colon tubulovillous polyp showed a grade 3/4 adenocarcinoma with signet ring features.
3.  April 15, 2010:  The patient was discharged from the outside hospital, and her hemoglobin was stable at that time at 11.8.  She underwent surgical evaluation afterwards, but decided to come to Labahn Veterinary Center for a second opinion on surgical options.
4.  April 20, 2010:  Patient was evaluated by Colon and Rectal Surgery here at Lakeside Hospital Medical Center.  In review of the CT-scan obtained on the outside from April 9, 2010, no metastatic disease was noted.  Of note, a few lesions were seen in the liver, but consistent with cysts.
5.  April 30, 2010:  Dr. Olsen completed a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.  Pathology showed an invasive grade 4/4 adenocarcinoma measuring 4.3 x 4.0 x 0.8-cm in the ascending colon that was 4.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor was invading through the muscularis propria and in the pericolic fat with no lymphovascular invasion noted.  Thirty nine sampled lymph nodes were negative.  The patient was thus staged as a T3N0M0 (stage IIA).
We were asked to consult on Mrs. Prime's postoperative treatment recommendations for a recently resected colon cancer.  Patient does have a history of Alzheimer's as well as multi-infarct dementia.  We are visiting with her today as well as her son, Xcbx, with whom she lives.  Her other son, Htsykqd, is her POA and also involved in her care.  The patient does not have any specific complaints today.  She says her pain is overall controlled.
