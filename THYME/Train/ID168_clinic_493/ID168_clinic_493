#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T2, N0, M0) and resected renal clear-cell carcinoma (T1, Nx)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Roberts service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Yedinak, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Mr. Harris has identified a local medical oncologist in the Iowa area whom he wishes to followup with.  Therefore, I am not making followup arrangements for him.  He understands the need for further adjuvant treatment of his rectal cancer.  He plans on following-up locally.  Therefore, I have asked Dr. Yedinak to visit with Mr. Harris prior to hospital dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  Certainly, if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to help facilitate care.
PATIENT EDUCATION

I was asked by Dr. Roberts service to visit with Mr. Harris for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Harris is a very pleasant 52-year-old male from Mounds Blue Eye.
1.  January 2010 - developed bright-red blood per rectum.  Evaluated with colonoscopy with identified a rectal mass 10-cm above the anal verge.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  Subsequent EUS showed a T3, N1 rectal adenocarcinoma.  CT imaging showed an indeterminate left kidney mass and the rectal cancer.  Subsequent PET scan also showed FDG uptake in the left kidney mass as well as the rectal tumor.
2.  May 2010 - Patient was evaluated jointly by Drs. Grim, Sam Rogerson, and Terry Bryant with the consensus to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation and subsequent surgery with additional adjuvant treatment.
3.  June 2010 to July 2010 - infusional 5-FU with concurrent radiation was given at Saint Luke West Medical Center for a total of 5040 cGy.  Overall tolerated well.
4.  September 10, 2010 - taken by Drs. Grim and Rogerson for a joint resection.  Underwent low-anterior resection as well as left nephrectomy.  Per operative note, there was no evidence of distant disease.  Left nephrectomy showed grade 3 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear-cell type, forming a 5.5-cm x 5.0-cm x 4.3-cm mass in the upper pole of the kidney.  This was confined to the kidney with the renal vein grossly free of disease and not involving the collecting system.  There were no hilar lymph nodes identified.  Staged at a T1b, Nx renal cell carcinoma.  Low-anterior resection showed microscopic foci of residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect arising in an ulcer measuring 4.2 cm x 2.0-cm x 0.4 cm in the rectum.  There was viable adenocarcinoma in the muscularis propria.  No lymphatic vascular invasion.  Negative surgical margins, and 2 of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with treatment effect.  Staged at a T2, N1, M0 resected rectal adenocarcinoma.
Mr. Harris is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
