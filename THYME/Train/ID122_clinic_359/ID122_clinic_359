#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma
I have reviewed all the above in-depth with Mrs. Toombs and her husband as well as my collaborating physician today.  Presently, overall, Mrs. Toombs is doing well by imaging today as we do not see any evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.  It would be our recommendation per our initial plan of care with Dr. Claude to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX for a total of four months, or eight cycles.  Mrs. Toombs received this locally through her medical oncologist near the Waconia area.  I have gone over the scheduled dosing of this drug as well as the common side-effects, and she has verbalized understanding.  At this point, I am not making follow-up arrangements for her, but certainly if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to help arrange care.  Mrs. Toombs is agreeable to our plan.
#2 PAME
Mrs. Toombs is scheduled for a Port-A-Cath placement tomorrow.  She would be medically acceptable for this planned procedure.
#3 A new, mild, bilateral, pyelocaliectasis and upper caliectasis and new upper ureterectasis
I have noted that Mrs. Toombs has new-onset of pyelocaliectasis, but she is asymptomatic with a stable creatinine.  We would recommend interval follow-up without pursuing any interventions at this point.

Mrs. Toombs is a very pleasant 69-year-old female from Stapleton Jamesport.
1. October 2009 - Developed progressive constipation, pain with sitting, and rectal bleeding.
2. January 11, 2010 - Colonoscopy performed showing a firm rectal mass protruding from the anus.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3. January 18, 2010 - CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis showing asymmetrical rectal thickening and a less than 1-cm regional lymph node.  No evidence of distant metastasis.  Chest x-ray negative.
4. February 16, 2010 - EUS done at Medical Center identified a T3, N1 rectal cancer with biopsy-proven with a lymph node from the perirectal area that confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma.
5. February 17, 2010 - Seen by Dr. Cota who recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation and subsequent abdominal perineal resection.
6.  February 18, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Claude of Medical Oncology and Dr. Mitchell of Radiation Oncology for a joint consensus whether to proceed with infusional 5-FU and concurrent radiation with hopeful surgical resection at a later date.
7.  February 24, 2010, initiated infusional 5-FU and concurrent radiation treatments through March 30, 2010.  Had a truncated course of radiation due to persistent perianal skin toxicity.
8.  April 20, 2010, developed decrease of strength in the left upper extremity and numbness and tingling.  Evaluated locally with an MRI of the head.  Noted to have a TIA of indeterminate nature.  Placed on aspirin.
9.  April 28, 2010, echocardiogram showing normal left ventricular chamber size and grade 1 of 4 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, mild left atrial enlargement, no evidence of significant valvular dysfunction.  Evaluated by our colleagues in Cardiology who deemed her an appropriate candidate for surgery as no cardiac causes for transient TIA found.
10.  May 4, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Morrison in Neurology.  Recommended further testing with a TEE and an MRI of the head and neck.
11.  May 7, 2010, ECHO (TEE) performed showing no significant abnormalities.  MRI of the head and neck showing some moderate stenosis in the right MCA bifurcation region and prominent atherosclerotic irregularity and stenoses in the left PCA and mild right PCA.  No other significant stenosis.
12.  May 11, 2010:  Underwent abdominal peroneal resection by Dr. Cota; no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology identified a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.0-cm in size in the anal canal invading just into the muscularis propria with eight negative lymph nodes and negative surgical margins; down-staged to T2, N0, M0 resected rectal adenocarcinoma.
Mrs. Toombs returns to have further discussion regarding her adjuvant chemotherapy for her resected rectal adenocarcinoma.  Presently, overall, she notes she continues to have some intermittent rectal soreness especially when sitting for long periods of time, but, other than that, has no pain.  She has a functioning colostomy in place with no blood, mucus, diarrhea, or constipation.  She occasionally has some incisional discomfort, but this is improving.  Overall, her energy level is good, and he is active.  She has no nausea or vomiting.  She has no fevers or night sweats.  Her appetite is good and her weight is stable.  She has no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.
