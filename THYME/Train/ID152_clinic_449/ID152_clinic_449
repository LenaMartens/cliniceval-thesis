#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N1(1 of 38), M0)
I have reviewed all of the above in-depth with Mr. Tracy Burnett through an interpreter as well as Dr. Morales.  At this point Mr. Tracy Burnett's scan does not show any evidence of recurrent metastatic disease, but there does appear to be some air in the bladder which is indeterminate.
From our perspective, we would like to start adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX for four to six-months.  Mr. Tracy Burnett does plan on staying in Albany for this treatment.  He notes at this point he does not feel that he is physically ready for chemotherapy, and he would like to delay this for an additional two-weeks.  I think this is overall acceptable, particularly in light of his other issues, mostly pain and depression that need to be better controlled, but I did indicate to Mr. Tracy Burnett that we would not want to wait more than six-weeks before initiating adjuvant treatment.  He understands this and would be agreeable to starting treatment if he has an additional couple of weeks to recover.  I also think this is a reasonable request considering his protracted hospital course and only recent hospital dismissal.  I will see him back later this afternoon with Dr. Sinclair.  We will discuss the overall plan and decide on an appropriate appointment for return for chemotherapy and Port-A-Cath placement.
#2 Pain
Mr. Tracy Burnett has chronic pain which does not seem to be well-controlled with his current pain regimen.  He has been taking narcotics preoperatively and had struggled with pain while hospitalized.  Currently his regimen of 20-mg of OxyContin twice-a-day is insufficiently controlling his pain.  I think that he would be best served by a referral back to our colleagues in the Pain Clinic for management.  In the interim I have refilled his OxyContin 20-mg tablet prescription, and he asked whether or not he could take this three times a day as he has been doing.  I thought this would be an acceptable plan until he sees our colleagues in Pain Clinic who will probably readjust his regimen.  He is comfortable with this at this point.
I have cautioned Mr. Tracy Burnett that all of the care providers are concerned about the potential for long-term narcotic addiction, particularly given his young age.  I do think at this point he still has residual pain-related to his surgery, but ultimately the goal would be to remove him from all narcotics.  He overall is agreeable to this plan, but at this point feels that his pain is suboptimally controlled and significantly negatively impacting his overall quality of life contributing to his sense of fatigue and overall depression.  Hopefully our colleagues in the Greenville Confederate Hospital can help us manage this pain situation.
#3 Depression
Mr. Tracy Burnett is symptomatic with depression.  I think it is related to his situation as well as inadequately controlled pain.  I have decided to start him on Celexa 20-mg daily.  I have cautioned him about the side-effects and also that it will take four to six-weeks before we note a significant improvement.  He is agreeable to this and actually also endorses the need for antidepressants.  He notes that he has no inclination for suicidal ideation and is overall feels well-supported by his family.
#4 Nutrition
Mr. Tracy Burnett is significantly malnourished.  Preoperatively he struggled with this and had subsequent significant weight-loss.  I have encouraged him to eat more and encouraged him to use supplemental Carnation Instant Breakfast or Boost or Ensure in addition to his food intake to help him continue to gain weight.  He is agreeable to this.

Mr. Burnett Burnett is a very pleasant 38-year-old male from New Smyrna Beach.  He has no prior medical history.
1.  February 2010, presented locally in New Smyrna Beach with a one-year history of change in bowel habits with increasing constipation and bloody stools.  Colonoscopy performed identified a 5-cm rectal mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  A CT-scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis; MRI/PET scan negative for distant metastasis.  EUS performed identifying a T4 (with questionable prostate involvement), N1 rectal cancer by EUS criteria, CEA 18.4.
2.  April 2010, E-consult to Dr. Sinclair of Colorectal Surgery recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation and surgery.  The patient did not pursue any treatment locally, nor did he come to the HC.
3.  June 9, 2010, presented to the HC with increasing abdominal pain, perineal pain, back and left leg pain, and increasing problems with constipation and blood as well as difficulty urinating.  He had a 50-pound progressive weight-loss over the last three-months.
4.  June 9, 2010, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis identifying closer involvement of the known rectal cancer with seminal vesicles but no evidence of distant metastasis.
5.  June 10, 2010, colonoscopy performed showing a large rectal cancer 5-cm from the anal verge occupying 50% of the circumference.  Biopsy again performed confirmed adenocarcinoma.  Multiple other polyps seen but no carpet of polyps.  CEA 48.
6.  June 11, 2010, seen by Dr. Reynolds of Colorectal Surgery, who recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
7.  June 11, 2010, MRI performed showing a mass 1.5-cm from the anal verge, extending over 5.5 cm in length with invasion into the mesorectal fat with extension to involve the right seminal vesicles and enlarged perirectal lymph nodes.  No evidence of distant metastasis.  Immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch appears negative.  Lynch syndrome deemed unlikely.
8.  June 15, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Markham of Radiation Oncology.  Recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation with possible IORT; scheduled to start radiation on June 21, 2010.
9.  June 16, 2010, evaluated by Medical Genetics.  Lynch syndrome ruled out.  Current testing for FAP and MYH undergoing.
10.  June 16, 2010, evaluation by Dr. Mccubbin of Medical Oncology, who concurred with overall plan and recommended infusional 5-FU as a radiosensitizer, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX.
11.  June 21, 2010, initiated external-beam radiation and concurrent infusional 5-FU through July 29, 2010.  Overall tolerated well.
12.  September 1, 2010, taken by Dr. Gerber and Dr. Markham for a complex APR with en bloc resection of the seminal vesicles on the right and left and end colostomy with IORT along the seminal prostate margin.  Seminal vesicles ultimately not involved.  Surgical pathology noting grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma forming a 5.3- x 3.2- x 1.4-cm mass in the rectum with treatment effect involving one of 38 regional lymph nodes invading through the muscular propria with no lymphovascular invasion evident.  Negative surgical margins, although 0.4 radial margin subsequently boosted with IORT.  Had protracted recovery and hospital course due to persistent pain and ileus.
Mr. Tracy Burnett returns in the outpatient setting for further evaluation and management.  He notes he was dismissed in the hospital approximately two-weeks ago, and he has not noticed a significant improvement.  His biggest complaint is excessive pain which is both constant in his abdominal area and pelvic area, both legs, and his anus.  He characterizes this as a 5 out of 10 constantly.  He also has intermittent sharp sudden quite severe pain which he characterizes as a 5 out of 10 which comes and goes.  He was given 30-mg twice-a-day of OxyContin when dismissed from the hospital but ran out of this prescription and has been taking 20-mg of OxyContin twice-a-day. This is inadequately controlling his pain.  He has not used supplemental oxycodone as he notes this gave him palpitations in the past.  He was managed by our colleagues in the Greenville Confederate Hospital while hospitalized, and he felt that they were very beneficial with their recommendations and would like to see them again for ongoing management.
He has a functioning colostomy in place and using MiraLAX daily and will have liquid bowel movements.  This is problematic for him and requires him to change his colostomy bag frequently.  He is somewhat disturbed by the fact that he was only given enough supplies for a month, and he feels as though he is going through these supplies quickly.  He does not wish to see the stoma therapy nurses again.  He notes overall his appetite is low but improving.  He has been able to maintain his weight.  He had one occasion of vomiting, but this was accompanied by severe pain.  Other than that he has had no nausea or vomiting.  He has had no fevers or night sweats.  He has no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.
His energy level is overall low.  He finds himself very depressed.  He notes he does not have much interest in any of the activities he previously found joy in and will cry often and often daily.  He notes he is having issues with urination, will have pain at the end of urination, and also notes air coming out at the end of urination.  He has not noticed any hematuria.
