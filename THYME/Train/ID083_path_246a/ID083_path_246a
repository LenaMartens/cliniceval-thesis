Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an exophytic mass (2.2 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm) located in the rectum, 1.6 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (of 13) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1a] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HAZLETT.
