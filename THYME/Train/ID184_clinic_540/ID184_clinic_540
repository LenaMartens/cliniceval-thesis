Returning today, two-weeks following his ultralow anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy for a very low rectal cancer.  Today we are going to remove some skin sutures that have been in place after his wound opened up.  The wound looks fine, and he is tolerating the stoma well.  He is due to see Stoma Therapy today.
He tells me he is having some problems with urinary retention, and, indeed, we let him home with self-intermittent catheterizations.  He is performing these every second day now with residual volumes of 2 to 3 ounces, he tells me.  I have encouraged him to increase this to twice-a-day and for him to measure his volumes accurately using a measuring container.  If he has more than 50-mL residual after passing urine, he should then continue to catheterize until this reduces.  I have also started him on regular Flomax.  Because of this, we will see him again in six-weeks' time at which stage if his symptoms have not settled we may have him see Urology.
He is due to see Medical Oncology in TX on Friday regarding further adjuvant chemotherapy based on his T3, N2 disease, and we will await this treatment completion before reversal of his ileostomy.
