Mrs. Kim Lynn is seen consultation today with regard to her resected colon cancer.  Her history, evaluation, and plan of care are well-outlined in a separate note from Dr. Jamie Krieger.  I have had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Lynn and confirm the findings of her evaluation.
Mrs. Lynn was recently-diagnosed with an early-stage colon cancer by her preclinical workup; however, definitive treatment was delayed because of the need to further evaluate her liver function.  Once her liver function was felt to be stabilized and at a point for her to be able to undergo surgery, Mrs. Lynn had a right hemicolectomy.  The resected specimen showed a T3 adenocarcinoma with no involvement of the 40 resected lymph nodes.
Based on the operative and pathology findings, I discussed with Mrs. Lynn and her husband that she is at low-risk for recurrence.  Based on the available factors, there is no reason to consider adjuvant therapy in this setting.  The potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy would be quite low and would likely compromise Mrs. Lynn's overall health.
Mrs. Lynn expressed a good understanding of our discussion, though at times she did repeat questions that indicated some apparent difficulty in comprehending what we had discussed.  Her husband, however, did appear to have a good understanding.
At this point, no followup will be planned in Fayetteville City Valley Hospital Center.  Mrs. Lynn will follow-up with her physicians for ongoing management of her liver disease and other health issues.  It would be good for Mrs. Lynn to have periodic assessment with regard to the resected colon cancer as felt appropriate by her primary-care physician.
