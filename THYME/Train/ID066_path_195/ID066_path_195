Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right through mid-transverse, resection:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative and polypoid mass (4.9 x 3.8 x 1.0 cm) located in the transverse colon, 4.4 cm from the distal margin.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic and vascular invasion is absent.  There are multiple (2) tattooed areas within the colonic mucosa located proximal and distal to the main tumor.  The appendix is unremarkable.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (of 46) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma.  An additional regional lymph node contains acellular mucin; no viable tumor cells.
