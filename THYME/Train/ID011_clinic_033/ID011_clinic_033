#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma (T2, N0, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Paul service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Ruiz, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
We are not recommending adjuvant chemotherapy in this situation.  Therefore, I will not make followup arrangements for Ms. Mingo to return in the outpatient setting.  I will ask Dr. Ruiz to visit with her prior to hospital dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  Certainly if the need arises in the future, I will be more than happy to help facilitate care.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

I have been asked by Dr. White's service to visit with Ms. Mingo for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Ms. Mingo is a very pleasant 69-year-old female from Keota Wellston.  She has a complicated past medical history significant for severe COPD, endocarditis, bioprosthetic St. Jude mitral valve repair, on chronic anticoagulation due to rheumatic heart disease, pacemaker implantation and status-post CABG, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, currently stable.
1.  September 30, 2010 - underwent colonoscopy identifying a mass at 50 cm.  Partially removed by polypectomy.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
2.  October 6, 2010 - developed abdominal pain.  Noted on imaging to have pneumoperitoneum due to perforated colon during colonoscopy.  CT imaging done without contrast due to an allergy showed a thickening of the gallbladder wall.  No evidence of distant disease.
3.  October 22, 2010 - taken by Dr. White for resection of a portion of the transverse colon and open cholecystectomy.  Surgical pathology from the colon identifying a mildly-differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a-1.1-cm x 0.9-cm x 0.4-cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon superficially invading the muscularis propria.  Negative surgical margins, and 5 regional lymph nodes negative for tumor.  Staged at a T2, N0, M0.  Gallbladder cholecystectomy showing an adenomyoma 2.2-cm x 1.7-cm x 1.5-cm in size in the fundus of the gallbladder.  No evidence of distant disease.
Ms. Mingo is continuing to recover from surgery and was currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
