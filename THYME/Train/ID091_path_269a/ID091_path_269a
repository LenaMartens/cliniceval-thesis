Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, epiploic tag, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

B.  Mesentery, small bowel, biopsy:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.

C.  Mesentery, small bowel #2, biopsy:  Treatment effect, no tumor seen.

D.  Mesentery, small bowel #3, biopsy:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.

E.  Mesentery, sigmoid colon, biopsy:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.

F.  Aortic bifurcation, posterior margin, biopsy:  Focally involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.

G.  Aortic bifurcation, biopsy:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""colonic epiploic tag rule out cancer"" is a 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm fragment of yellow-pink adipose tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by HUNTER.

B. Received fresh labeled ""small bowel mesentery mass"" is a 3.2 x 3.0 x 3.1 cm aggregate of pink fibroadipose tissue, partially solid cut surface on sectioning.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ESTRADA.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel mesentery mass #2"" is a single 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm fragment of tan tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by ESTRADA.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel mesentery mass #3"" is a 6.2 x 3.5 x 2.9 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue with partially solid cut surface.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by ESTRADA.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon mesentery nodule"" is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm fragment of pink-yellow soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by HUNTER.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""aortic bifurcation tumor posterior margin"" is a 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm fragment of tan tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by ESTRADA.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""tumor at aortic bifurcation"" is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of pink-yellow soft tissue fragments.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HUNTER.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Dave Pichardo, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue showing adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon mesentery (block E1).  Upon completion, results will be available in FHWD YoibNztw.



Internal Comments
