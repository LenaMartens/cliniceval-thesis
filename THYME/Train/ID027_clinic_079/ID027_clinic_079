#1 Newly-diagnosed biopsy-proven colon adenocarcinoma
I have reviewed all of the above in-depth with Mrs. Roth and her daughters, as well as my collaborating physician.  She is a pleasant 85-year-old female with biopsy-proven colon cancer seeking treatment recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Benjamin Cheeks through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
