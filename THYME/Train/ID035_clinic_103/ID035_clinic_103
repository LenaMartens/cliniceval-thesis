#1 Rectal cancer
Discussed evaluation with Mrs. Sturges. Her husband was in the waiting room, and she requested she be seen alone. Discussed reasoning behind the EUS procedure scheduled for tomorrow. I do not think we need to repeat a full colonoscopy here.  However, I have specifically requested our endoscopy colleagues to look at the area in the sigmoid that had inflammation as well as these other polyps from 25 to 30 cm in addition to tattooing distal to the rectal tumor.  We will have her outside CT-scan reviewed here.  I may decide to add a liver ultrasound as her CT was done without contrast to get a good view of the liver if this is indicated.  We will get CEA.  I will see her with Dr. Omar Muse later this week following her testing and surgical consultation.  Briefly discussed that likely there is a good chance she may need preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery later.  She would like to obtain an opinion here from our medical and radiation colleagues if this is indicated.  Discussed she will likely need an abdominal operation unless this is found to be early-stage on the EUS.  Hopefully she would be a candidate for a low-anterior resection.  I did discuss the potential that she may need a diverting loop ileostomy if she needs neoadjuvant therapy.
#2 Hypertension
Well-controlled.
#3 Hyperlipidemia
Well-controlled.
#4 Anemia
Related to No. 1.  We will get an updated CBC today.  I have discussed with her to stop her aspirin completely, and if she needs something before bed, she can take acetaminophen. This is likely contributing obviously to her blood loss and anemia.
#5 Hyperkalemia
We will recheck her potassium and sodium level today prior to her undergoing another bowel prep for the EUS.
#6 GERD
Well-controlled.
#7 Elevated glucose
We will recheck a fasting glucose here to make sure she does not have any problems with impaired glucose tolerance.
#8 PAME
Will get EKG, chest x-ray, and additional LFTs.
#9 Umbilical hernia
Likely this can be fixed if she needs an abdominal operation.  Will discuss with Dr. Muse.  This is minor and is not causing her significant symptoms.
I will see her back with Dr. Muse on Friday.  All questions were answered.  She was seen alone.  Seventy minutes spent.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, but would like additional information. Advance Directive information packet provided to the patient. XY5249-37, WP1845-34, TE3408-71, LF7881-45.
Code status:  Discussed with the patient.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Sturges was seen at the request of Dr. Ramirez for surgical evaluation for rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mrs. Sturges is a 72-year-old female from Arlington, Lake Oswego, with a six-month history of rectal bleeding.  This initially only occurred intermittently, but then she began to have heavier bleeding occurring with each bowel movement. She has been having daily bleeding for the last two-months.  She sought evaluation recently and was scheduled for a colonoscopy on March 29, 2010, performed by Dr. Ramirez.  This was a difficult colonoscopy per his report.  They were not able to cannulate the ileocecal valve, but this was identified.  She had a polyp located right near the dentate line that was initially biopsied, but after the biopsy it appeared that all the tissue had been removed.  Pathology here revealed a hyperplastic polyp.  From 10 to 12-cm from the anal verge she had a large polyp that encompassed quite a bit of the luminal circumference that was biopsied.  Pathology here revealed moderately-differentially adenocarcinoma arising within a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  The tumor involved the submucosa and extended to the deep biopsy margin.  This was not tattooed.  She also had an area of inflammation as well as multiple small polyps between 25 and 30 cm from the anal verge.  The largest polyp was biopsied and has been confirmed here as a hyperplastic polyp. It was mentioned she had an extremely redundant colon. She had a normal colonoscopy in 2004 per her report.
She has undergone staging with a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on April 5, 2010, that we will review here.  Per local review, this revealed thickening of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon without pelvic lymphadenopathy.  Interesting, she had an absent left lobe of her liver.  The study looks as if this was done without contrast as she has had a significant reaction to IV contrast including hives necessitating steroid injection.  Lab work performed locally on March 25, 2010, revealed a hemoglobin of 11.5 and hematocrit of 33.8.  I do not have a local CEA.  She had an elevated glucose of 115.  Renal function tests were within normal limits.  She had a low-potassium of 3.4 on March 29.
Mrs. Sturges denies a family history of colorectal cancer.  She has been a little more fatigued or "slowed down a little bit" in the last few months.  She has had long-standing problems with her bowel habits.  When she was a child she remembers having problems with her bowels.  She would alternate between constipation and diarrhea.  In reviewing her outside records, she was diagnosed with IBS.  For a lot of her adult life she had used a laxative pill once-a-week.  She does not remember the name.  She has a history of having to strain with her constipation, but then she would also have diarrhea every-other-day.  She was started on antihypertensive medications, Lotrel and atenolol, approximately two years ago, and then she said her bowel habits changed and she noticed that she was having more constipation.  In the last six-months, as discussed above, she has been noticing bleeding.  Her current bowel habits include passing small amounts of stool about every-other-day.  She denies nausea or vomiting.   She denies fecal incontinence. The bleeding is daily and will occur sometimes when she urinates.  Sometimes it is small amounts, and sometimes it is larger and colors the water red.  About three-to-four times a day she will pass blood with occasional clots.  She has only used a laxative pill once in the last couple weeks.  No blood transfusions.  No anorectal surgeries previously. Her appetite has been good.  She has not had significant weight-loss.
