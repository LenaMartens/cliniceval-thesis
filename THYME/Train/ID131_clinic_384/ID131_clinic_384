#1 Newly-diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma in the presacral space
Mr. Macdonald is a very pleasant 42-year-old male with newly-diagnosed mucinous adenocarcinoma in the presacral space seeking treatment recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Judith Browne through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline her recommendations in her subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mr. Macdonald is a very pleasant 42-year-old male from Ohio Macon.  He has a prior past medical history significant for Crohn's disease treated initially with a total proctocolectomy at age 17 in 1985.  He has had subsequent resections in 1993 due to strictures and recurrent fistulas as well as in 1995 for a perforated gastric ulcer as well as strictures and a fistula.
1. June 2009 presented with pelvic pain.  CT-scan showing presacral fluid collection.
2. July 2009 to September 2009 JP drain placed.  Drained bloody/milky substance.
3. September 2009 CT-scan showing decreased fluid collection.  Drain pulled.
4. September 2009 underwent small-bowel resection due to multiple small-bowel strictures, lysis of adhesions, takedown enterocutaneous fistula, and transposition of ileostomy to the left abdomen.
5. October 2009 patient complained again of worsening/returning pelvic pain.
6. October 2009 CT-scan performed showing increasing fluid in the presacral space.  Culture is positive.  Placed on antibiotics and JP drain placed.  Atypical cells present, but negative for malignancy.
7. January 14, 2010, CT-scan performed showing no evidence of distant metastasis but persistent presacral fluid collection.
8. January 30, 2010, underwent surgical debridement of soft-tissue in the presacral area.  Pathology return as mucinous adenocarcinoma.  Uncertain whether tumor started in the rectal stump versus the small-bowel.
9. February 8, 2010, PET scan performed showing some mild FDG uptake in the posterior pelvis but no significant residual fluid identified.  No areas of distant or metastatic disease.
10. February 12, 2010, MRI performed of the pelvis showing heterogenous enhancement of the presacral region involving the rectal stent.  No focal areas to suggest local recurrence.  No distant metastasis identified.
Mr. Macdonald has been referred to the HCH to discuss possible treatment options for his newly identified mucinous adenocarcinoma and fluid collection in the presacral space.  Presently, overall, he has persistent pelvic/tail bone pain which he notes has improved since his surgical debridement but is consistently 4 to 5 out of 10 treated with Endocet one tablet every six hours.  He has occasional abdominal pain depending on his diet.  He has a functioning ileostomy in place with no evidence of blood or mucus, mostly liquid in nature.  He has a good appetite but has lost 20 pounds in the last year, but he does believe his weight has stabilized recently.  Overall, his energy level is low, but he continues to work full-time, but he does admit his energy level is worsening over time. He has no fevers or night sweats.  He has no nausea or vomiting.  He has no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.  He has noted new-onset leg and arm cramps.
