#1 Resected mucinous adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Williams service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Olivarria, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
I have explained the pathology to Mr. Macdonald and his significant other in-depth.  As previously outlined in Dr. Russo's plan of care prior to surgical resection, we do anticipate the need for adjuvant chemotherapy.  Mr. Macdonald at this point notes that he would like to receive this at HCH.  He would also like to return in approximately four weeks for evaluation by Dr. Russo.  To this end, I have ordered a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, postoperative evaluation by Dr. Hart, and in anticipation of additional chemotherapy, I have pre-ordered a chemotherapy time.  Mr. Macdonald already has a Port-a-Cath in place.  All questions were answered.

I was asked by Dr. Williams service to visit with Mr. Macdonald for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Macdonald is a very pleasant 42-year-old male from Ohio Macon.  He has a prior past medical history significant for Crohn's disease treated initially with a total proctocolectomy at age 17 in 1985.  He has had subsequent resections in 1993 due to strictures and recurrent fistulas as well as in 1995 for a perforated gastric ulcer as well as strictures and a fistula.
1. June 2009 presented with pelvic pain.  CT-scan showing presacral fluid collection.
2. July 2009 to September 2009 JP drain placed.  Drained bloody/milky substance.
3. September 2009 CT-scan showing decreased fluid collection.  Drain pulled.
4. September 2009 underwent small-bowel resection due to multiple small-bowel strictures, lysis of adhesions, takedown enterocutaneous fistula, and transposition of ileostomy to the left abdomen.
5. October 2009 patient complained again of worsening/returning pelvic pain.
6. October 2009 CT-scan performed showing increasing fluid in the presacral space.  Culture is positive.  Placed on antibiotics and JP drain placed.  Atypical cells present, but negative for malignancy.
7. January 14, 2010, CT-scan performed showing no evidence of distant metastasis but persistent presacral fluid collection.
8. January 30, 2010, underwent surgical debridement of soft-tissue in the presacral area.  Pathology return as mucinous adenocarcinoma.  Uncertain whether tumor started in the rectal stump versus the small-bowel.
9. February 8, 2010, PET scan performed showing some mild FDG uptake in the posterior pelvis but no significant residual fluid identified.  No areas of distant or metastatic disease.
10. February 12, 2010, MRI performed of the pelvis showing heterogenous enhancement of the presacral region involving the rectal stent.  No focal areas to suggest local recurrence.  No distant metastasis identified.
11.  March 16, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Len Hart and Dr. Judith Browne.  Recommendations included consideration of possible neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation and surgery for hopeful surgical cure.
12.  March 22, 2010, seen by Dr. Smith who recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation.  Case evaluated by Dr. Russo.  Recommended infusion 5-FU as a radiosensitizer to accompany the radiation but given at a significant dose reduction due to prior Crohn's disease and multiple bowel resections.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed noting a small fluid collection between the seminal vessels and the lower sacrum, 2.0 x 4.5-cm.  No evidence of distant disease.
13.  April 19, 2010, initiated concurrent radiation and infusional 5-FU at a 5-FU dose of 150-mg due to history of  Crohn's disease, through May 21, 2010, for a total of 45 cGy over 25 fractions.  Overall tolerated well.  5-FU slowly adjusted up to a total dose of 200-mg.
14.  July 2, 2010, taken by Dr. Hart for complex pelvic resection with completion of abdominoperineal resection and intraoperative radiation therapy by Dr. Smith.  Per the operative note, there was no evidence of distant disease and all gross tumor was resected.  IORT was given for the possibility of microscopic disease.  Surgical pathology showed left pelvic floor tumor and additional left pelvic floor tissue consistent with moderately-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  There were negative surgical margins.
Mr. Macdonald is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
