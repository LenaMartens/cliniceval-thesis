Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm) located 2.5 cm from the distal resection margin, which is histologically negative.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the adjacent pericolic fat.  The distal, proximal, and radial surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.8 cm, radial margin).  Multiple (2) tumor deposits within pericolic fat that represent discontinuous spread or venous invasion with extravascular spread are identified. Multiple (5 of 18) regional lymph nodes are completely replaced by carcinoma, with treatment effect.

With available surgical materials, [AJCC ypT3N2] (7th edition, 2009).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and sigmoid colon"" is a 19.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  The radial margin is inked.  A 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm ulcerated mass is present within the rectum, 2.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 0.8 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ARANT.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Residual invasive adenocarcinoma.  Margins negative.  HOLD to assess lymph nodes on permanent sections.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Morgan B. Davis, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
Seen in consultation with Dr. Bobby J. Boltz.


Addendum Diagnosis
Due to the patient's young age, reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC will be performed; when completed, results will be available in QHXO CezaErdz (molecular genetics report).
