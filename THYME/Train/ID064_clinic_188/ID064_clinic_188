#1 Cecal carcinoma
Mr. Rock is an 83-year-old male who was recently hospitalized in Boyce, Louisiana, with weakness, shortness-of-breath, and anemia.  His hemoglobin was found to be 8.6.  Reportedly, it had been 12 earlier last year.  He was given 2 units of blood.  EGD was performed January 14, 2010 and was essentially normal.  Colonoscopy was performed on the same date and a small round polyp identified at the level of the splenic flexure.  The polyp was removed.  In addition, in the right colon a circumferential mass within the cecum was noted.  It was very irregular; it also involved and extended into the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum.  Pathology from home showed biopsies of the distal esophagus, no evidence of esophagitis or intestinal metaplasia.  Acute and chronic inflammation of columnar epithelium with granular, possibly foreign, material identified.  The splenic flexure polyp was found to be a tubular adenoma, benign, and the cecal mass was an invasive adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.  Mr. Rock has had no further staging and now comes to Blue Health Care Center for further investigation, and if surgery is indicated, he wishes it done here.  He has had no GI complaints and no major change in bowel habits.
