#1 Resected stage III cecal adenocarcinoma in the setting of a history of a resected stage IV sigmoid carcinoma several years ago
The new stage III cecal carcinoma was completely resected by Dr. Thomas on January 29, 2010.  No residual disease was left behind and there is no evidence of metastatic disease.  Mrs. Stackhouse's postoperative course was benign.  I discussed with her and her husband the potential benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy.  I stated that the purpose of the chemotherapy is to decrease the risk of metastatic spread and recurrence.  She understands that there is a good chance of non-recurrence without chemotherapy and that, on the other hand, the tumor could still spread metastatically despite chemotherapy.  I explained that the current standard of care consists of FOLFOX combination administered 12 times over half a year.  We discussed side-effects including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, immune suppression, diarrhea, mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, and cold intolerance.  She understands this and is still very eager to go ahead with the therapy.  However, she would like to have this done closer to her home, which is north of Buckeystown.  She also has identified an oncologist there.  I also stressed the necessity for follow-up after completion of her therapy.
#2 Postoperative atrial flutter
This has not reoccurred after Mrs. Stackhouse's discharge from the hospital.  She continues on Cardizem and will follow-up with a cardiologist close to her home.
#3 Polymyalgia rheumatica
For this Mrs. Stackhouse is currently treating with prednisone.  She is currently actively tapering the medication.
#4 Hypertension
This is currently under good control with the ACE-inhibitor.
#5 Hypothyroidism
This is being treated with Synthroid.  She will follow-up for this with her primary-care physician at-home.
#6 Hyperlipidemia
#7 Hypercholesterolemia
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at TOTC.

Mrs. Stackhouse's oncology history is as follows:
1.  December 2002 - Surgical resection for a T3, N1, sigmoid adenocarcinoma.  Specific details regarding lymph node involvement unclear.
2.  January 2002 - Imaging showed two liver lesions.
3.  January 2002- Surgical resection by Dr. Jesse Wiseman of two hepatic lesions 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.0-cm and 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.9-cm, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with a colon primary.
4.  2006 - Radiofrequency ablation of one lesion seen on a PET scan in the right lobe of the liver.
6.  January 13, 2010 - Colonoscopy showed a mass in the cecum.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma. No evidence of metastasis.
8.  January 29, 2010 - Right hemicolectomy by Dr. Thomas.  The surgical pathology report describes a grade 3  adenocarcinoma forming a 5.6- x 3.4- x 0.3-cm mass in the cecum invading into the pericolonic fat.  Two of 17 regional lymph nodes were positive for adenocarcinoma.  Staged at T3, N1, M0.
Mrs. Stackhouse is now coming to Belle Amis Memorial Hospital for a follow-up visit after her surgery and to discuss adjuvant chemotherapy.  She states that her postoperative course was very unremarkable and that she almost feels back to normal.  Her appetite is good.  She has not lost any weight.  Has no pain or other complaints.  She denies nausea and vomiting and palpitations.
A CT-scan done earlier today shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other abnormalities other than surgical sequelae.  A CEA is 2.1.  CBC is positive for a hemoglobin of 10.4.  Otherwise, CBC and chemistry are within normal and acceptable limits.
