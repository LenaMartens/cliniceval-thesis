#1 Metastatic colorectal cancer to the lungs
#2 Possible abscess in the pelvis
The lung nodules are small and have not changed.  At this point, I would not recommend consideration for any operation to the lung nodules, and I would not recommend chemotherapy.  Observation for another two-to-three months is in order to see what happens to her lungs before any decisions are made on whether attempt at surgical resection of those nodules is reasonable and possible or advisable.
Regarding the fluid collection in the pelvic area, I would leave this up to Dr. Batchelor who is seeing the patient later today and whether intervention is needed.  The patient's difficulty to sit may be related to this, but things have not been getting worse, and she does not seem to be having clinically an active infection, although this is not my area of expertise.

Ms. Lorenzo is a 66-year-old female who has the following history:
*In 1995, a vaginal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids.  Incidental discovery of a stage IIA, well-differentiated leiomyosarcoma.
*In 1996, recurrence of the leiomyosarcoma as a 14-cm mass growing in the third fallopian tube.  Treated with exploratory laparotomy, removal of residual adnexa, omentum, and debulking with positive biopsies of the pelvic side wall and sigmoid colon.  She was treated with adjuvant radiation for a total of 50.4 Gy and six-months of MAID chemotherapy.  She has remained free of recurrence since then.
*June 2007, discovery of a T3, N0 rectal cancer and an incidental paraganglioma as a perirectal mass.  Treated with resection.  No adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy was given.  Ileostomy was reversed in February of 2008, and surveillance colonoscopy in May 2009 and October 2009 were negative.
*November 2009, thickening of the presacral area is followed by PET scan that showed significant activity there.  There were also bilateral pulmonary nodules that were small but multiple and suspicious for metastasis.  A rectum anastomosis biopsy on the 14th of December showed recurrent, invasive, grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma.
*January 2010, patient meets with gastrointestinal surgeon (Dr. Batchelor), thoracic surgeon (Dr. Solum), and Radiation Oncology (Dr. Tse).  Decision is made to proceed with chemotherapy (FOLFOX) and, if complete radiologic response is seen in the lungs, consider treatment for locoregional control of the recurrent rectal cancer in the anastomotic site and the presacral area.
*February 2010, patient had a reaction to the MoviPrep that she received for the colonoscopy.  Following this, she had a colostomy performed locally.
*August 3, 2010, patient returns after 11 cycles of FOLFOX.  A PET scan in June showed complete radiologic response to the cancer of the lungs.  CT-scan in August showed complete resolution of the lung nodules and reduction in the size of the pelvic malignancy.
*September 14, 2010, to October 5, 2010, 30 Gy of chemoradiation with capecitabine.
*October 6, 2010, complex resection of the descending colon, sigmoid, rectum and anus with a portion of piriformis,
and presacral fibrosis with creation of end-colostomy.  Intraoperative radiation therapy for a total of 1.25 Gy.
*October 27, 2010, patient returns for followup post-surgery.  Her only symptom is that she has pain in the perianal area when she sits down.  This has not changed and it is slowly getting better.  No fever, chills, sweats.  No diarrhea or constipation.  No drainage, no staining of her clothes.  No belly pain, nausea, or vomiting.
