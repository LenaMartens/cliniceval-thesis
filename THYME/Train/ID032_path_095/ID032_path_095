Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid, rectum, terminal ileum, en-bloc, resection:  Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, forming a 9.5 x 7.5 x 7.4 cm ulcerated, annular mass in the sigmoid colon.  The tumor directly invades the ileum with mucosal involvement and resulting ulceration.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  Multiple (24) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  Surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCCpT4N0] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Colon, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:   Proximal anastomotic ring identified grossly.

C.  Colon, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Distal anastomotic ring identified grossly.

D.  Kidney, left renal mass, partial nephrectomy:  Grade 2 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, forming a 2.6 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm mass.  The tumor is confined to the kidney.  Coagulative tumor necrosis is absent.  Sarcomatoid differentiation is absent.  The surgical margins are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCCpT1aNX] (7th edition, 2010).


This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled portion sigmoid, portion of rectum, incontinuity, en bloc, loop terminal ileum is a 24.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with a patent stent placed.  There is a 9.5 x 7.4 x 7.5 cm ulcerative annular mass 3.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the mucosa, muscle, and pericolonic fat, and is also adhesed to a 29.0 cm segment of terminal ileum. The mass grossly involves the wall of the terminal ileum.    Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat. Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by WOODCOCK.

B.  Received fresh labeled proximal anastomotic ring is a 3.0 cm in diameter x 1.0 cm in length portion of tan-pink unremarkable annular mucosa with embedded suture and staple material. Gross only.  Grossed by GAMBREL.

C.  Received fresh labeled distal anastomotic ring is a 2.0 cm diameter x 0.7 cm in length portion of tan-pink unremarkable annular mucosa with embedded staples.  Gross only.  Grossed by GAMBREL.

D.  Received fresh labeled left renal mass is a 5.5 x 4.2 x 1.1 cm partial nephrectomy specimen.  There is a 2.6 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm yellow cystic and solid mass, located 0.3 cm from the inked resection margin.  The tumor does not extend into the perirenal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HUTCHENS
