Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, segment III, biopsy:  Steatosis, negative for tumor.

B.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis containing a single mixed stone (5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm) present in the lumen and a single cholesterol stone (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) identified within the gallbladder wall.

C.  Liver, portion of segment IVB, subsegmental resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) colonic adenocarcinoma forming a mass (5.8 x 5.0 x 4.3 cm), completely excised (0.5 cm from the closed surgical resection margin).

D.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, polypoid mass (6.2 x 5.2 x 3.3 cm) located in the ascending colon, 3.2 cm distal to the ileocecal valve.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  There are also multiple (2) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) identified in the ascending colon.  A single (1 of 34) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1aM1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment III biopsy"" is a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm liver biopsy.  A single 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm tiny white nodule is identified.  All submitted.  Grossed by YANG.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is an 11.6 x 4.3 x 3.7 cm gallbladder with a 0.3 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  A single mixed stone (5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm) is present in the lumen, and a single cholesterol stone (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) is identified within the wall.  The gallbladder mucosa is nodular.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by YANG.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of liver segment IVB"" is a 180.0 gram, 11.6 x 7.2 x 6.0 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 5.8 x 5.0 x 4.3 cm lobulated, necrotic, white-yellow mass is present 0.5 cm from the surgical resection margin. Grossly, there appears to be tumor in a vessel.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by YANG.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 9.3 cm of terminal ileum and 30.2 cm of cecum and ascending colon.  The appendix is absent.  A 6.2 x 5.2 x 3.3 cm ulcerated and polypoid mass is present within the ascending colon, 3.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 19.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  There are also multiple (2) polyps (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) located in the ascending colon, distal to the tumor.  Multiple (36) regional lymph nodes are submitted.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by YANG.
