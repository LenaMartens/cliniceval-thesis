Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectum, and anus with anastomosis, abdominal perineal resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma is identified forming mass (5.5 x 3.3 x 2.3 cm) located in the perirectal soft tissue in the region of a prior anastomosis site.  Tumor invades into the bowel wall up to lamina propria.   Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (27) diverticula are also identified.  Multiple (6 of 20) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Soft tissue, right pelvic side wall, excision:  Fibrovascular connective tissue.  Negative for malignancy.

C.  ""Lymph node"", right pelvic side wall, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma involving soft tissue.  No lymphoid tissue identified.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N2] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
