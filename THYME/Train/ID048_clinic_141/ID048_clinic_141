Dr. Hayes's Service consulted Medical Oncology to assess whether patient can receive systemic chemotherapy with palliative intent while the perineal wound is still not closed.  The perineal area does not show any signs of acute infection.  The area seems to be healing quite nicely.  From my personal standpoint, I do not think that chemotherapy needs to be delayed any further.  However, it is also clear that it does not need to be rushed to be initiated since the patient is in a palliative setting with liver and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases.  Patient claimed that he had never heard about the presence of liver metastases.  I highlighted to him that any systemic chemotherapy is meant to control the disease as long as possible.  He has a well-established connection with Dr. Hart who would be his primary contact person once he is being discharged from Covington Hospital.
Again, with regard to the chemotherapy, I would not see a problem to start the treatment as soon as the patient is discharged.  I would favor using a modified FOLFOX 7 regimen without bolus 5-FU.  It has to be pointed out that this regimen can be administered in a patient with slightly increased creatinine, meaning impaired kidney function.  The patient's creatinine is at 1.5.
I would not like to see bevacizumab/Avastin administered since this could delay wound healing more than FOLFOX.
Mr. Gadson was content with the information he received.  All questions were answered.
We will sign off on the case for now and will be more than happy to consult on the patient back if new questions arise.

Mr. Gadson is a 49-year-old patient who is under the oncologic care of Dr. Terry Hart from the Sunny Hill Community Hospital group.  He was diagnosed with a rectal cancer earlier this year and underwent neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU as radiation sensitizer before going for an APR in August of this year.  Since then, the patient has had wound healing complications with regard to the perineal wound.  It is of note that he has a history of drug abuse, and at the time of presentation with his initial diagnosis, he was found to have bilateral ureter obstruction which were addressed by bilateral ureteral stent placement.  Since the abdominoperineal resection, he also has a neurogenic bladder which is taken care of by a continuous Foley catheter placement.
Most recent scans indicate the emergence of liver metastases with progression of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  So far, chemotherapy has not been initiated in view of the still healing perineal wound.  The patient was now hospitalized to address the wound healing issue.  Details can be found in the notes from our surgical colleagues.
Upon visit today, Mr. Gadson mainly complained about pain in his abdomen around the colostomy site.  He has a long-standing history of lower back pain which has not changed over the last weeks.  Further details of his history can be found in Dr. Taylor note.
