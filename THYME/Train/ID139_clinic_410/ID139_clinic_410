I personally met with the patient and wife.  Reviewed his key medical records.
Briefly, he is a 63-year-old man who on EUS had a T2-N0 lesion preceded by colonoscopy which reached the cecum (preoperative CA of 4.3).  He underwent LAR revealing a grade 3 adenocarcinoma of 3.4 cm involving the rectum, T3 with 5/41 lymph nodes involved.  Per the clinical notes, Dr. Harrison stated the rectal tumor was above the peritoneal reflection, and therefore, did not feel radiation therapy was absolutely necessary.
Patient also has indeterminate pulmonary nodules and indeterminate liver nodules, all too small to characterize.  The liver lesions were negative by ultrasound.
I explained to the patient that our routine management of rectal cancer was six-months of adjuvant therapy.  Chemotherapy would almost always be involved, and we routinely would use radiotherapy with radiosensitizing chemo.  However, in this particular situation, given the high location of the rectal tumor, above the peritoneal reflection per Surgery, I agree that radiotherapy is not absolutely necessary.  Unfortunately, our clinical data does not provide definitive guidance on this issue.  We discussed the toxicities of radiotherapy, and we will also discussed the issues revolving around locally recurrent tumor.  Either way, the patient will receive his therapy at-home, and I would advise systemic chemotherapy with FOLFOX for 4 cycles to start with.  We extensively discussed the toxicities and potential benefit of adjuvant FOLFOX.  I stated that following that two-month period of FOLFOX, he and his oncologist he may have a clearer idea of his experience with chemo, and evolving thoughts on radiotherapy resulting from ongoing discussions his home oncologist and with a radiation oncologist.
I answered all their other questions.  They expressed understanding, appreciation, and agreement.
