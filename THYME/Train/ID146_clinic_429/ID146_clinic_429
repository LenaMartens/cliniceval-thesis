#1 Sigmoid polyps and sigmoid cancer
Mrs. Tai is a 33-year-old female who was worked-up since January for diarrhea.  Apparently had C. difficile and has been treated off-and-on with Cipro and Flagyl for approximately eight weeks.  Her C. difficile testing (unknown type) positive as early as two-weeks ago.  She was having multiple stools, some blood, and now one stool a day.  Her work-up lead to flexible sigmoidoscopy on 25 March 2010, and this showed multiple polyps, sessile type, in the sigmoid.  Pathology has been read here, and sigmoid colon polyp shows grade 2 (of 3) adenocarcinoma.  Tumor involves muscularis mucosa, but depth of invasion could not be assessed due to tangential sectioning and superficial nature of the biopsy.  Other sigmoid colon polyps showed multiple tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia.  Random left colon biopsy showed focal active colitis.  Patient has had no further testing and comes here for further evaluation and treatment.
