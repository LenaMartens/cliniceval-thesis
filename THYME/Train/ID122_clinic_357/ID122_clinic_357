Mrs. Toombs is a pleasant 69-year-old female from Stapleton Orondo who unfortunately has Stage III (T3, N1) rectal cancer, and has undergone pre-operative neoadjuvant treatment. Dr. Cota had met with her in the past. Only significant event during her treatment was a TIA. She is relatively asymptomatic now. Recent Cardiology and Neurology work-ups non-worrisome, and no contraindications to surgery. Mrs. Toombs was just on 325-mg of ASA pre-operatively, which has been stopped. Once cleared, it was deemed acceptable to proceed with an APR for her disease.
Her PMH and PSH is outlined below.
