Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph nodes, right external iliac, excision:  A single (1 of 2) right external iliac lymph node (2.6 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm) is positive for metastatic grade 4 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features and marked treatment effect (rare single and small groups of viable tumor cells associated with acellular mucin and calcifications).  

B.  Lymph nodes, left external iliac, excision:  A single (1 of 3) left external iliac lymph node (3.0 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm) is positive for metastatic grade 4 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect (rare single and small groups of viable tumor cells).  
.

C.  Lymph node, apical superior hemorrhoidal, excision:  A single apical superior hemorrhoidal lymph node is negative for tumor.

D.  Lymph node, left internal iliac, excision:  A single (1 of 1) left internal iliac lymph node (3.0 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm) is positive for grade 4 (of 4) metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect (rare single and small groups of viable tumor cells).  Extranodal extension is present.

E.  Soft tissue, perivesical fat, excision:  Benign adipose tissue.  No lymphoid tissue identified.

F.  Rectum and anus, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens, pelvic exenteration:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and marked treatment effect (occasional single and small groups of viable tumor cells associated with acellular mucin and calcifications) forming an ulcerated, circumferential mass (7.2 x 6.7 x 4.6 cm) situated in the rectum, located 4.2 cm from the dentate line and 5.7 cm from the anal skin margin.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to extensively involve the perirectal adipose tissue.  The tumor involves the adherent the left and right seminal vesicles with extension into the mid and superior posterior prostate and focally into the external muscularis propria of  the posterior wall of the urinary bladder.  Multiple (2) inflammatory polyps (0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm) are noted in the rectum, distal to the tumor mass.  The bladder mucosa shows mild chronic inflammation.  The resection margins are negative for tumor (closest tumor free margin, 0.1 cm, left pelvic side wall).  Multiple (23 of 48) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect (rare single and small groups of viable tumor cells).  Extracapsular extension is noted.  Multiple (12) tumor deposits are identified within the perirectal soft tissue.  

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT4bN2b] (7th edition, 2010).

G.  ""Lymph node"", left piriformis, excision:  Benign adipose tissue.  No lymph node tissue identified.

H.  Lymph nodes, right obturator, excision:  Multiple (4) right obturator lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Photograph taken.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right external iliac lymph node"" are multiple (2) lymph nodes (2.6 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm and 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm).  The largest lymph node is mucinous.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""left external iliac lymph node"" are multiple (3) lymph nodes (3.0 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm, 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm).  The largest lymph node may be multiple matted mucinous lymph nodes.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""apical superior hemorrhoidal lymph node"" is a 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm aggregate of adipose tissue with a single 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""left internal iliac lymph node"" is a 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm mucinous lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""peri-vesicle fat, rule out nodes"" is a 6.3 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm portion of adipose tissue.  Lymph nodes are not identified grossly.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""Rectum and anus, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens"" is a 35.3 cm segment of rectum and anus, bladder (6.3 x 6.2 x 3.4 cm) with attached right ureter (4.7 cm in length) and left ureter (4.2 cm in length), and prostate (4.2 x 4.0 x 3.6 cm) with bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens.  There is a 7.2 x 6.7 x 4.6 cm ulcerated, circumferential, mucinous tumor in the rectum located 4.2 cm from the dentate line and 5.7 cm from the distal anal skin margin.  Grossly, the rectal tumor invades through the bowel wall to involve perirectal adipose tissue, the mid and superior posterior portion of the prostate, and the bilateral seminal vesicles.  The tumor involves the perirectal soft tissue most extensively in the region of the left pelvic sidewall (to within 0.1 cm of the inked radial margin).  The bladder mucosa is uninvolved by tumor.  There are also multiple (2) polyps (0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm) in the rectum located distal to the tumor.  Multiple (67) regional colonic lymph nodes and multiple (2 right, 1 left) perivesical lymph nodes are identified.  Photograph taken.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""left piriformis lymph node"" is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm aggregate of adipose tissue, lymphatic tissue not identified grossly.  All submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.

H.  Received fresh labeled ""right obturator lymph nodes"" is a 4.8 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  Multiple (4) lymph nodes are identified (ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 3.8 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm).  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by PERINO.
