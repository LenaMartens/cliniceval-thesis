Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, cecum, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid and centrally ulcerated mass (3.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm) located in the cecum, 4.6 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  A single (of 36) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  There are multiple (2) hyperplastic polyps (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm and 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm) located in the proximal colon.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
