Final Diagnosis
A.  Terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon and transverse colon, resection:  Poorly differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 5.1 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon and transverse colon"" is a resection specimen consisting of 4.5 cm in length ileum, 30.0 cm in length portion of rectum.  A 5.1 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm ulcerative mass is present within the transverse colon, 2.5 cm from the mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the muscle. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by FRANKLIN.



Addendum Diagnosis
Immunoperoxidase stains were performed on block A1.  The tumor is strongly positive for CK7 and CDX2.   CK20 is focally strongly positive.  Chromogranin and synaptophysin are negative.  This immunophenotype is consistent with colorectal primary.
