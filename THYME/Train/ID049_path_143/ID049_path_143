Final Diagnosis
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis.

B.  Lymph node, periportal, biopsy:  A single benign lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.

C.  Liver, right lobe, resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colorectal origin, forming multiple (6) masses (ranging in size from 1.3 cm to 4.1 cm in greatest dimension).  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.4 cm).

D.  Colon mesentery, left, biopsy:  Involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  A single benign lymph node is also identified.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

A.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 13.5 x 4.5 x 1.8 cm gallbladder with a 0.5 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  No stones are present within the lumen.  No masses are identified.  Cholesterolosis is identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CHAMBERS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""periportal node"" is a 3.2 x 3.1 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by CHAMBERS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""right lobe of liver"" is a 1185.0 gram, 20.3 x 14.9 x 6.8 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  There are multiple (6) masses (ranging in size from 1.3 cm to 4.1 cm in greatest dimension) which are 0.4 cm from the closest resection margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CHAMBERS.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""left colon nodule"" are multiple (2) portions of fibroadipose tissue (4.2 x 2.4 x 1.1 cm and 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm).  Within each portion of adipose tissue, there is a tan-white nodule (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm and 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm, respectively). Grossed by BRAGDON.
