Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 3.7 x 2.4 x 0.9 cm ulcerative mass in the rectum, at the dentate line.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 1.2 cm of the radial resection margin and 2.7 cm from the distal anal skin margin.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A tubular adenoma (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm) is present in the sigmoid colon and a hyperplastic polyp (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) is present in the rectum.  Multiple (6 of 29) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma [AJCC pT3N2MX].  

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid, rectum, anus"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 36.3 cm in length portion of sigmoid, rectum and anus.  A 3.7 x 2.4 x 0.9 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, at the dentate line, 2.7 cm from the distal anal skin margin, and 1.2 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (2) polyps (rectum, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm located 1.7 cm proximal to the tumor; sigmoid colon, 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm located 3.2 cm from the proximal margin) are identified within the specimen.  Multiple (30) lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LITCHFIELD.



Addendum Diagnosis
Due to the patient's young age, reflexive testing for microsatellite instability will be performed; when completed, results will be available in JMGZ KyyhEggr (molecular genetics report).


Internal Comments
""Reflexive"" MSIO missed at frozen section so ordered after-the-fact/rjc
