Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (0.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm) located 1.7 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Tumor invades the underlying submucosa.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. An additional tubulovillous adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia (3.7 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm) is present, located 2.5 cm from the invasive adenocarcinoma and 2.7 cm from the distal resection margin. Multiple (3) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia are also present.  Multiple (16) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT1N0] (7th edition, 2010).

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in NRDI OkpxIcmu.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid, rectum"" is a 25.6 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon. There are multiple (7) polypoid lesions.  The largest polypoid mass is  3.7 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm  mass located 2.7 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the mucosa.  Multiple (3) additional smaller polyps are identified (ranging in size from 0.4 - 0.9 cm). The nearest polyp is 1.7 cm from the distal surgical resection margin and located 2.5 cm from the largest polypoid mass.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by PATTERSON.
