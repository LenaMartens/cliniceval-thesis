#1 Rectal cancer
1.  Long-standing of history of ulcerative colitis for about 20 years.  He developed increased frequency of stools and had colonoscopy at-home on November 9, 2009.  This showed a polypoid mass at 12-cm that was soft.  This was not particularly large or ulcerated.  Biopsy confirmed invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  He had fairly quiescent colitis elsewhere but there were some focal areas of active colitis on other biopsies.
2.  Had endoscopic ultrasound at River Bend Center on December 8, 2009.  This showed that about 18 cm from the anal verge there were several, i.e., two or three small less than 5-mm lymph nodes which were aspirated.  Once again, there was a
T2 lesion extending into but not beyond the muscularis propria in the rectum.  At the level of the rectal tumor there were no lymph nodes.  The cytology from the aspirated lymph nodes above the tumor in the perirectal region were positive for malignancy.  A CT enterography showed asymmetrical wall thickening, mucosal involvement in the rectosigmoid colon.  No evidence of extension into the adjacent fat.  No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.  Changes of ulcerative colitis noted in the distal descending and sigmoid colon.  A 2-cm right kidney cyst was noted.  Chest x-ray was negative for metastatic disease.
3.  Seen at River Bend Center December 10, 2009.  Neoadjuvant treatment plan with radiation and 5-FU.  Patient returned for neoadjuvant treatment and was given Xeloda with radiation.  He developed a severe reaction with significant diarrhea, dehydration and required TPN.  He received only 17 of 28 planned radiation treatments and the Xeloda was also discontinued.
4.  March 22, 2010, total proctocolectomy by Dr. Jamie D. Ross.  There was residual tumor in the primary but all 29 nodes were negative for metastatic disease.
5.  April 26, 2010, patient seen in Oncology, and four months (eight cycles) of adjuvant FOLFOX was recommended.
Patient returns now having completed four months of adjuvant therapy.  He still has some neuropathy, but otherwise he is doing well.  He tolerated his treatment without difficulty.  He has no new problems.

Abdomen:  Ileostomy but otherwise negative.Pelvis:  Perineum--there is a pea-sized nodule in the scar in the perineum.  He had some delayed healing with a stitch.  I suspect this is simply scar.Heart:  Regular sinus rhythm.Reports:  Laboratory tests--CBC and chemistries are fine.  The CT-scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease.  Note that the questionable nodule in the perineum is not well-defined on this.Lymph:  Nodes nonpalpable.Lungs:  Clear.Skin:  Examined and normal.
