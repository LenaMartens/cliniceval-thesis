#1 Node-positive rectal cancer, s/p low-anterior resection
I have discussed the pathologic findings with the patient and explained that the node positivity of his disease merits a more aggressive adjuvant approach than simple surveillance for disease recurrence. He and his family expressed understanding at my explanation of tumor biology and the fact that nodal involvement signifies a higher risk of the disease returning in the future. We aim to reduce this risk with the use of adjuvant therapies, often in these cases a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.
I recommend a Radiation Oncology consult at this point to solicit their opinion on whether a "sandwich" approach of chemoradiation is warranted in this case. I explained to the patient that he could either receive 6 months of adjuvant FOLFOX, or a "sandwich" approach of 2 months of FOLFOX --> concurrent 5FU-based chemoradiation for 6 weeks --> 2 months of FOLFOX.
In either event, the patient can return to Medical Oncology (GI) clinic in one-month at the same time as his post-operative follow-up to discuss adjuvant options in greater detail after an appropriate amount of time has elapsed to allow wound healing to occur.
Thank-you for this interesting consult. Will staff with Dr. Brown in the morning. At that time, we can elaborate on the anticipated side-effects of chemotherapy. We will mention the possibility for myelosuppression and nausea/vomiting with both agents. With specific regard to the 5FU, we will mention stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome, and diarrhea. With specific regard to oxaliplatin, we will mention cold sensitivity, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. We will also address the need for Port placement if 5FU infusions are anticipated, although the patient has already expressed an interest in oral capecitabine. Furthermore, he will wish to base his oncologic care in Pittsburg.

The patient is a 67-year-old male with the following oncologic history:
1) Iron-deficiency anemia detected in spring 2010 prompts a CEA check on May 4th (level = 3.4) and a colonoscopy on May 18th, 2010, which revealed a 3-cm nearly circumferential mass in the rectum, 15cm. from the anal verge. Pathology was consistent with invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. With regard to synchronous lesions, multiple other polyps were seen in the cecum, hepatic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon, ranging from 5 to 14mm in size, the pathology of which was consistent with tubular and tubulovillous adenomas.  CT abdomen/pelvis on May 19th showed rectal thickening with some mild hazy stranding of the perirectal fat but no clear lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of hepatic metastases and two indeterminate nodules were seen in the left upper lobe of the lung.
2) On June 4th, the patient is seen in Tucson Medical Center Colorectal Surgery clinic and an MRI of the pelvis is ordered, showing "a 2.6 x 2.0-cm sessile mass arising from the left posterior wall of the superior rectum, approximately 15-cm from the anal verge. This lesion appear[ed] to invade the muscularis propria but [was] mostly confined within the wall. In a small portion, however, the tumor [was] very close to the outer margin and mild invasion into the perirectal fat in this region [could not] be excluded. The perirectal fascia [was] not thickened. No significant lymphadenopathy." The patient is re-evaluated by Dr. Ramos on June 7th, who recommends proceeding with a low-anterior resection.
3) On June 28th, the patient undergoes low-anterior resection with end-to-end anastomosis. Operative pathology reveals an "invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma ... forming an exophytic mass (2.2 x 1.8 x  0.8-cm) located in the rectum, 1.6-cm from the distal mucosal margin. The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent. All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. A single (of 13) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma." Excision of the distal rectosigmoid ring showed unremarkable colonic mucosa. With available material, he is staged as pT3N1a.
On review of systems, the patient confirms that he developed bright-red bleeding per rectum and constipation `R`6 weeks prior to his colonoscopy, but had attributed these changes to severe hemorrhoids. Constitutionally he has unintentionally lost 10 lbs. in the same time period. He has no significant abdominal pain. He has no self-appreciated "lumps or bumps".
