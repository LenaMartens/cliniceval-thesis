Mr. Schrupp is a 57-year-old male with recurrent colon cancer.  He had a sigmoid colon resection elsewhere on November 11, 2005, for colon cancer.  He completed chemoradiation on December 9, 2009.  Unfortunately, PET scan in July 2009 showed a mass near aortic bifurcation.  Due to his elevated creatinine (3.7) on January 8, 2010, he was admitted to RMH on January 11, 2010 and had right ureteral stent placement by Dr. Fowler and left nephrostomy placement by Interventional Radiology on January 12, 2010.  He then had left ureteral stent insertion through left nephrostomy on January 15, 2010.  His creatinine was declined to 2.8 on January 15, 2010.  He comes to the LUNH for the surgical management on January 18, 2010.
