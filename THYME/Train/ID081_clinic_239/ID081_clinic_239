#1 Rectal cancer in a gentleman with prior histories of colon cancer
His surgeries have been done elsewhere.  More recent surgery was around the prostate.  He also has distal ureter tumor requiring resection.  Currently has a psoas hitch on the right.  His left kidney is not functioning as well.  There is also left ureteral obstruction.  Discussed with him the plan which is to remove the rest of the sigmoid colon and rectum.  Whether or not I could do a primary anastomosis remains to be seen.  It really depends on how much length of rectum is left there.  He would prefer not to have a permanent stoma if he could.  He does understand that with a very short rectum that he may have increasing urgency, increasing frequent bowel movements, and incontinence.  He is comfortable with that decision.  He recalled his ostomy in the past and did not like the ostomy at that time.  Discussed with him the risks and benefits of the procedure.  He has midline incisions which we will use at this time.  We will plan for a completion colectomy/proctectomy and maybe have a very low anastomosis, diverting loop stoma, versus a permanent stoma altogether.  We will see how things go.  Discussed with him the risks and benefits of the procedure, risks for infection, bleeding, anastomotic leak, damage to bladder or ureters.  He understands and currently consented for this Thursday.  He also would like to see if his right inguinal hernia can be repaired, so we will try to get Dr. Tracy Rodriguez to see him if we could.  Otherwise, we will set-up whoever is available.  Dr. Sanchez mentioned that he may be a difficult patient to put a Foley catheter in much less a ureteral stent.  We will plan for urologist as-needed.

Mr. Auld has a prior history of right hemicolectomy in 1973.  He was about 36 at that time.  Then another tumor of the transverse colon in about 1983 so he would have been 45 at that time.  Actually, his first surgery required a diverting colostomy prior to surgery.  He did not require chemotherapy.  He does report a sister having colon cancer in her 60s.  He also reports several aunts with GYN-type cancers.  He did mention that his sister was told to see or at least saw a geneticist, but no formal genetic counseling has been done.  He has two sons.  Both have had colonoscopies recently, and they were both unremarkable.  He currently has an ileosigmoid anastomosis with the anastomosis being 30 cm from the anal verge.  At about 10-cm from the anal verge was a 2-cm sessile polyp removed by Dr. Enriquez.  Final pathology showed invasive adenocarcinoma.  He currently denies any fecal incontinence, does have urinary incontinence.  Currently one-to-two stools per day.  The rest of his past medical and surgical history documented in chart.  The other thing he mentioned today was a recurrence of his right inguinal hernia repaired once in the past with mesh.  Currently has a recurrence or at least a bulge that he can see.
