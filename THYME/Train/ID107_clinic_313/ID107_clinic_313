#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Dawson is a 42-year-old male who had rectal outlet bleeding for approximately six-months.  Colonoscopy showed a 25-mm rectal tumor at the anal verge.  There was also a proximal significant polyp 5-mm in size which was removed and a larger 15-mm pedunculated polyp in the distal sigmoid which was removed as well.  Pathology sides have been read here.  Proximal sigmoid polypectomy was hyperplastic polyp, distal sigmoid polypectomy was hyperplastic polyp, rectal polypectomy was hyperplastic polyp, and distal rectum was infiltrating grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Patient comes for further evaluation and treatment of the above.
