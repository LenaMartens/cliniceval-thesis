Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with treatment effect is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm) located 9.0 cm from the dentate line.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor (minimum tumor free margin, radial margin, 0.5 cm).  Multiple (4 of 21) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The largest metastasis measures 4.2 cm in greatest dimension and likely represents multiple matted lymph nodes.  Extranodal extension is present.  A tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia (2.0 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm) is identified distal to the adenocarcinoma, 2.5 cm from the dentate line.

B.  Sigmoid, additional, excision:  Tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia (0.3 cm in greatest dimension) located 6.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum, sigmoid and anus"" is a abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 25.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 2.5 cm in length portion of anus.  A 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm ulcerated mass is present within the rectum, 9.0 cm from the dentate line, 11.0 cm from the anal mucosal margin, and 0.5 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  A second (distal) polypoid mass (2.0 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm) is identified 2.5 cm from the dentate line and 5.0 cm from the anal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LISTER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""additional sigmoid colon"" is a 15.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with a 0.3 cm polyp located 6.5 cm from one mucosal margin; otherwise, the mucosa is unremarkable.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the pericolonic fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by SUTTON
