DIAGNOSIS
#1 Distal rectal cancer
Mr. Tracy Burnett presents for evaluation and treatment of distal rectal cancer.  I had a very frank discussion with him about the need to restage, and given the progression of his symptoms, I am suspicious of T4 disease at this point.  We will start with a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess not only for the extent of pelvic disease but as well as for liver and pulmonary metastasis.  We will also obtain an MRI of the pelvis given his radicular symptoms to rule-out any nerve or spine involvement.  Endoscopic ultrasound is not felt to be helpful at this time given that previous EUS was positive for nodal disease, and we are well aware of the recommendations for preoperative chemoradiation treatment.  Colonoscopy will however be requested to assess the lesion's location, obtain biopsies for immunohistochemistry staining to rule-out Lynch syndrome, given his young age of onset, and also to rule-out synchronous neoplasm.  It is possible that the scope may not be able to be passed through this growth, and a pediatric scope may need to be considered.  MoviPrep prescription was provided.  At the conclusion of his staging studies, we will ask him to meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery.  I have discussed with the patient my suspicion that he may require a permanent colostomy at this point given the progression of the tumor down into the rectum.  We will be placing a tattoo on the distal margin of the tumor during colonoscopy.  I will hold off on a stoma nurse visit until patient has met with the Colon and Rectal surgeon to discuss surgical resection more in-depth.  Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology consultations will be arranged for after the surgeon consultation.  We also discussed role for a rectal stent if he is obstructing; however, this would be a very distal stent and may cause a fair amount of discomfort.  Additionally, I discussed dietary measures with him given his significant weight-loss including the need for nutritional supplements as tolerated.  We discussed avoidance of constipation, and I recommended he use Colace and/or milk of magnesia.  I also prescribed Percocet one-to-two tablets every four to six hours as-needed for pain given that the Tramal he currently is using is not effective for him.  I will continue to follow-up with him throughout this process for results and further recommendations.  Patient is agreeable to immunohistochemistry staining to assess for Lynch syndrome.
I discussed with Dr. Hannah Smith.  Note to follow.

Mr. Burnett Burnett is a 38-year-old gentleman from Richmond who presents for evaluation and treatment of distal rectal cancer.  Mr. Tracy Burnett was symptomatic for several years with changes to the bowel habit and dietary intolerances.  As defecation became more difficult and bleeding commenced, he sought medical evaluation.  A colonoscopy in February 2010 was positive for a mass at 5-cm in the rectum.  Staging CT abdomen and pelvis, PET scan, and MRI were all negative for metastatic disease.  Endoscopic ultrasound suggested nodal involvement, and there was question of T4 involvement on the prostate; however, this was not obvious on CT evaluation.  CEA was 18.4 ng/mL.  Mr. Tracy Burnett then had an e-consult with Dr. Ellen Sinclair from Colon and Rectal Surgery here at HC April 12, 2010, and considering his outside evaluation, it was suggested that he proceed with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection and probable coloanal anastomosis.
Unfortunately, Mr. Tracy Burnett did not pursue this treatment, and his symptoms have progressed.  He currently states he has lost 50 pounds since February, and has developed abdominal pain, perineal pain, and low-back pain, and now pain radiating down the left leg over the past ten days.  His pain is aggravated with defecation immediately, during, and after.  Use of Tramal (similar to tramadol) has not effectively managed his symptoms.  He has been utilizing milk of magnesia at bedtime to facilitate defecation.  He states he normally has a bowel movement after each meal.  Bleeding continues as well, and he also has fatigue and loss of appetite.  He has not had a recent intervention, although states that the local physician suggested a diverting ileostomy prior to undergoing chemoradiation before resection.  He presents now to Albany for evaluation and treatment.
Mr. Tracy Burnett is otherwise healthy with no chronic comorbidities include no cardiopulmonary symptoms or history.  His only previous surgery was a fixed septum of the nose in 1988.  He denies an chest pains, chest pressures, shortness-of-breath, or exertional symptoms.
