Mr. Mccormick is being referred to Peoples Memorial Hospital to discuss potential surgical options to remove his focal lesion in his liver and his apparent local recurrence in the upper pelvic area.  I spent some time with the patient and his family reviewing the outside CT scans.  The CT scans reveal a mass close to the left ureter in the area of the prior sigmoid resection.  In addition, there is a low-attenuation lesion which is PET-positive in the liver.  I had a chance to discuss the situation with Dr. Durham, the colorectal surgeon the patient is going to see later today.  We are probably facing a multimodality approach here toward the pelvic local tumor recurrence which will likely include Urology as well as Radiation Oncology for potential preoperative radiochemotherapy and eventually intraoperative radiation therapy.  In addition, Dr. Durham would like to perform a colonoscopy preoperatively, particularly in view of the multifocal initial appearance of the cancer.
The patient is cleared for surgery from my side.
I will also have the patient seen by our cancer geneticists in view of his young-onset colon cancer.
Mr. Helms was content with the information he received.  All questions were answered.  For his arterial hypertension, which was again manifest here, I provided medication with lisinopril 5-mg per day.

Mr. Mccormick is a very pleasant 40-year-old patient who is being referred to Medical Oncology at Peoples Memorial Hospital to obtain an opinion regarding the future management of his metastatic and recurrent colon cancer.  His oncologic history started in July of 2006 when he was diagnosed with a sigmoid cancer characterized as a multifocal, moderately differentiated colon cancer arising from a villous adenoma.  He underwent sigmoid resection.  Pathology confirmed a T2, N0 cancer with 11 lymph nodes resected, all of which were not involved with cancer.  In view of the stage I disease, no further adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.  Also, no genetic testing was performed.  It is of note that the patient has a twin brother who underwent colonoscopy and was found to have polyps.
During a follow-up CT-scan in November of 2009 a moderate left hydronephrosis and a small pelvic mass obstructing the left ureter was found.  In addition, a low-attenuation region in the right liver lobe was seen.  A PET/CT-scan confirmed tracer uptake in both of these areas.  Subsequently, the patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 and had received six cycles of therapy from December to February 17, 2010.  No bevacizumab was added.
Upon presentation today, the patient stated that he had tolerated the chemotherapy very well.  He had noticed cold-induced sensory neuropathy which has completely resolved.  No diarrhea.  No pain.  He has a tendency toward constipation.  His last endoscopy was in September of 2009.  Most recently, his blood pressure was noticed to be elevated in spite of the fact that he never received bevacizumab.
