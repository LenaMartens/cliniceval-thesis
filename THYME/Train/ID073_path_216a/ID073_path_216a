Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, left perivesical region, biopsy:  Fibroadipose tissue, negative for tumor.

B.  Vaginal cuff, left, biopsy:  Fibromuscular tissue, negative for tumor.

C.  Vaginal cuff, right, biopsy:  Fibromuscular tissue, negative for tumor.

D.  Rectum and portion of vagina, resection:  Recurrent grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 4.8 x 3.2 x 0.8 cm mass invading into perirectal soft tissues.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (4) perirectal lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E.  Small bowel and colon, ileocolonic anastomosis, excision:  Portion of bowel with anastomosis, negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
