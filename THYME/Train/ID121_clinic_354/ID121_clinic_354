#1 Rectal cancer
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Fultz who also met with Mr. Mcgee and his wife.  Please see his supervisory note.  As there are discrepancies in regard to whether or not the lesion is past the muscular propria and CT-scan read here questions wall thickening in the rectosigmoid as well as the rectum, we have decided that patient needs a repeat colonoscopy, rectal ultrasound.  I asked them to tattoo 1-cm below the rectal lesion if possible.  Patient scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, and due to his heart disease, cardiology consultation as well.  He is also scheduled for Medical and Radiation Oncology and Colon and Rectal Surgery, Dr. Jane Burdett.  In addition, even though slides have been read here, we have asked for the tissue block for testing for immunohistochemical staining.

#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Mcgee is a 47-year-old male who saw his doctor because he was fatigued.  He was found to have a low ferritin but apparently normal hemoglobin according to Mr. Mcgee.  He had not checked his stool for blood.  This led to EGD and colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy found a 3-mm polyp in the sigmoid colon which was removed, a rectal mass with the top of the lesion at 5-cm from the anal verge, bottom of the lesion 3-cm from the anal verge, and about 2-cm from the dentate line.  Biopsies were taken.  In addition, a 6-mm semipedunculated polyp was seen distal to the mass lesion at about 1-cm from the anal verge.  This was removed as well.  Pathology reading here showed the polyp at 30 cm to be a hyperplastic polyp, rectal mass at 4-cm intramucosal adenocarcinoma, no muscularis mucosa or submucosa identified, and the polyp at 20 cm, polypectomy was tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  Patient then went on 14 January 2010 to have a rectal ultrasound.  A small movable mass towards the posterior midline was felt on digital exam.  The mass was estimated to be 2-cm in diameter.  There was no adenopathy noted on the ultrasound, and the tumor appeared to invade the muscularis propria in one small area.  No obvious tumor invasion beyond the muscularis propria, and this was considered consistent with a T2 lesion.  Patient also had CT abdomen and pelvis 4 January 2010 and that has been read here.  A tiny liver cyst otherwise negative.  Negative pancreas and adrenal gland.  Spleen normal size.  Normal-appearing kidneys.  Mildly prominent left periaortic lymph nodes just below the level of the left renal vein.  No prior studies for comparison.  Mildly prominent central mesenteric lymph nodes.  Enlarged prostate and cystic dilatation of the seminal vesicles bilaterally and diffuse nodular thickening of the walls of the rectosigmoid colon and focal mass-like thickening of the anterior/posterior walls of the distal rectum.  Patient apparently had another rectal ultrasound done at the Huntsville Hospital, but we do not have that record.  Patient now comes for further investigation of the above.
