Mrs. Work is a pleasant 65-year-old female from Rush, who presents to Dr. Pearcy Service for the chief complaint.  She had a low-anterior resection done in the past and has recurrent disease.  She has completed another round of chemotherapy.  The original stage of her disease was T2, N0.  Beginning in April of this year, she was treated with 5-FU and had concurrent radiation therapy.
She met with Dr. Griffin in Radiation Oncology and Dr. Guidry on August 26 to discuss the possibility of intraoperative radiation therapy in the setting of hopeful definitive resection of the recurrence.  However, after going over the risks and benefits, the patient did not wish to have intraoperative radiation therapy and is hopeful that curative resection alone can be done.
Her past medical and surgical history is outlined below.
