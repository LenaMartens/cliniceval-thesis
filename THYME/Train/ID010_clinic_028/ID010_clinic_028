LABORATORY
ECG as noted above.  Chest x-ray shows normal cardiothoracic silhouette and clear lung fields.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Chest pain syndrome
This could be due in part to coronary spasm in the setting of previously documented angiographically normal coronary arteries.  Some of her chest pain is no doubt noncardiac.  I do not think that functional testing will be of any benefit here.  I think she should remain on nitrates pre- and postoperatively and use nitroglycerin to treat episodes of chest pain.  As long as there is no electrocardiographic ST-segment deviation or features of hemodynamic compromise, I think a medical treatment course will be most appropriate.
#2 History of asthma
#3 Diabetes mellitus type-2
#4 Hypertension
#5 Orthopedic issues
#6 Cecal carcinoma with planned surgery next week

Review of cardiac status.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

The patient is referred by Dr. Jamie Andrews for preoperative cardiac clearance.  I have known Mrs. Dunbar for a long-time and am familiar with her situation.  Unfortunately, she has recently developed what appears to be a cecal carcinoma and will have surgery on Monday.  She has had a chronic intermittent chest pain syndrome.  Initially, we diagnosed angiographically normal coronary arteries with coronary spasm, but this was many, many years, perhaps even decades, ago.  I have seen her intermittently through these years, and her pain has remained basically the same.  She gets unpredictable episodes of central chest discomfort, which have variable nitroglycerin relief.  They are typically nonexertional though tend to occur more often at the end of the day if she does too much activity.  She has a fairly active social life with several book clubs and other study clubs, and her chest pains generally do not seem to interfere with these activities nor do they typically occur just with exertion.  In the past, we had tried a variety of vasodilators, but she either was intolerant or had no benefit from a variety of calcium-channel blockers.  Nitroglycerin has been the mainstay of her therapy.  She uses a nitroglycerin patch, which she should continue throughout her surgery and postoperative period as well as uses sublingual nitroglycerin.  Often, she requires several nitroglycerin tablets for relief, and it is unclear whether her chest pain syndrome now is actually cardiac or is a noncardiac condition.  There are no features of heart failure, syncope, or dysrhythmia.  She has chronic lower-extremity edema for which she uses vascular support garments.  She has hypertension, which has been worse lately with the stresses of her illness.  The last echocardiogram I see is from 2002, and it was entirely normal at that time.  Her electrocardiograms at rest have always been normal as is her current one.
