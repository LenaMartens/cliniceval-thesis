Mrs. Mcadams is a 54-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease and multiple small-bowel resections.  Unfortunately, she was found to have cancer in the rectosigmoid area when she was explored on October 16, 2009 for what sounds like an enterovaginal fistula.  She received chemoradiation and was re-explored by Dr. Giese in 63389.  The operative note indicates that this was involving the left pelvic sidewall and the base of the bladder and was unresectable.  She then received additional chemotherapy.  CT abdomen and pelvis on April 26, 2010 showed interval decrease in the cystic or necrotic mass at the apex of the Hartmann's pouch and vaginal vault.  She comes to the FMC for the surgical management on May 4, 2010.

1. Age 17, diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
2. August 1985, hysterectomy, appendectomy, and partial small-bowel resection.
3. 1999, partial small-bowel resection.
4. April 4, 2005, partial small-bowel resection.
5. October 2009, colovaginal fistula.  On October 16, 2009, she had a diverting colostomy.  Unfortunately, the stricture was resected, and the pathology reported as a rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma.  The tumor was not totally resected.
6. October 28, 2009 - December 8, 2009, radiation therapy of 5040 rads in 28 fractions over 42 days.  Xeloda was given during this.
7. February 3, 2010, attempted resection of the rectal stump, but the surgeon states that "there was tumor in the proximal to mid rectum adherent to the left pelvic side wall and what appeared to be the base of the bladder near the left ureter.  I could not find a dissection plane in that region to safely proceed.  There were extensive adhesions in the pelvis which radiated to small-bowel.  There was a rent in the dome of the bladder that was repaired in two layers with Monocryl."
