Final Diagnosis
A.	Rectum, low anterior resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated, forming a 3.4 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm exophytic mass in the rectum, located 5.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The tumor extends to within 2.8 cm of the radial resection margin.  A 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm area of fat necrosis is present within the mesentery.  One (1 of 30) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma. 

B.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable 1.0 cm portion of rectal anastomotic ring.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled rectum is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 30.8 cm in length portion of rectum.  A 3.4 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm ulcerative and polypoid mass is present within the rectum, 5.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin and 2.8 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (37) lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat and are submitted for permanent sections.  A grossly positive regional lymph node measures 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  There is a 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm mass in the mesentery, probably fat necrosis.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by GOLDSMITH.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal ring"" is a 1.0 cm segment of distal rectal anastomotic ring.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by GOLDSMITH.
