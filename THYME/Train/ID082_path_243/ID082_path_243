Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, forming an ulcerative mass (3.6 x 3.5 x 0.7 cm) in the cecum, 2.7 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  Multiple submucosal lipomas present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (35) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.
