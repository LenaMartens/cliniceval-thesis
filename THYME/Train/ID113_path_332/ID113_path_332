Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, left lobe, needle core biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

B.  Liver, segment III, biopsy:  Simple cyst (0.4 cm in greatest dimension).  The surrounding parenchyma shows marked steatosis.

Special stains (reticulin, trichrome and PAS) were performed.  The liver parenchyma in part B shows a preserved architecture. 

Seen in consultation with Dr. Jamie Marrufo.

C.  Liver, segment II, biopsy:  Bile duct adenoma.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Jamie Marrufo.

D.  Liver, segment VIII, biopsy:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (0.7 cm in greatest dimension).

E.  Liver, segment V, biopsy:  Bile duct adenoma (0.4 cm in greatest dimension).

Seen in consultation with Dr. Jamie Marrufo.

F.  Liver, segment VII, resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a mass (2.2 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm).
G.	Rectum, resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderate (grade 3 of 4), forming a 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm ulcerated mass in the rectum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the perirectal fat.  The tumor demonstrates significant treatment effect.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 0.6 cm of the radial resection margin.  The tumor is located 1.2 cm from the distal margin.    One (of 5) lymph nodes is positive for metastatic carcinoma.
