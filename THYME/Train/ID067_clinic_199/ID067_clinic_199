LABORATORY
Reviewed his laboratory studies.  CBC and electrolyte panel are within normal limits.  CEA is 2.5.  Reviewed his CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis which shows no evidence of residual disease.
IMPRESSION, REPORT, AND PLAN
#1 Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma T3, NIB, MI status-post resection
Discussed with Mr. Lewis and his family that currently he has no evidence of residual disease.  He underwent an RO resection.  There is no evidence of tumor recurrence.  However, due to the fact that he had metastases at the time of presentation, we would recommend adjuvant therapy in the form of FOLFOX.  I discussed with him the side-effects associated with the FOLFOX regimen which includes but is not limited to nausea, vomiting, fatigue, myelosuppression, and risk for infection.  He will also require a Port-A-Cath placement.  We discussed the need for treatment which would be six-months in duration and on an every-two-week schedule.
#2 Dental abscesses
He currently has a dental abscess for which he has been treated with antibiotics.  We recommend addressing his dental issues prior to initiation of chemotherapy.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN
The patient will contact us after he has had his dental evaluation completed locally.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mr. Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman from Newport News California.  His oncologic history is as follows.
1.  December 29, 2009:  He presented with a two- to three-month history of low abdominal pain.  Chills and a 30-pound weight-loss over two years.  A CT-scan was obtained which revealed a 5.2-cm cystic growth in the subcapsular area near the right lobe of the liver.  Also noted was an abnormal soft-tissue density causing a mass effect off the cecum.
2.  January 19, 2010:  He underwent a colonoscopy which documented two lesions.  One was a-1.1-cm growth in the rectum.  Pathology was positive for tubulovillous adenocarcinoma with low-grade dysplasia and a focus of high-grade dysplasia.  The second nodule was in the cecum and was biopsied positive for invasive adenocarcinoma.  Additional testing was negative for Lynch syndrome.
3.  February 2, 2010:  He was taken to surgery by Dr. Reed from Colorectal Surgery and Dr. Anderson, and he underwent a right hemicolectomy and excision of a perihepatic adhesion.  Surgical pathology revealed that the tissue from the perihepatic adhesion was positive for metastatic grade 2 (4) adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary.  It was a cystic mass almost entirely filled with mucin and surrounded by a fibrous wall.  Right hemicolectomy revealed an invasive grade 2 (4) adenocarcinoma located at the ileocecal valve.  All surgical resected margins were negative.   Also 2 (11) regional lymph nodes were positive and showed extranodal extension.  Hence, it was staged as T3, NIB, MI.
Mr. Lewis returns for discussion of adjuvant therapy.  He has recovered completely from the surgical procedure.  His appetite is good.  His weight has remained stable.  He has good energy levels and has an ECOG performance score of 1.
