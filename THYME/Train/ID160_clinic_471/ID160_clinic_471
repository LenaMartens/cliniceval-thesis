#1 Sigmoid colon cancer
I discussed with Mrs. Merchant as her endoscopy was performed with good prep by Dr. Emig all the way to the ileocecal valve, I do not think we need to repeat a full colonoscopy here.  We will have Dr. Tracy Singley perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy to verify the tattooing and to verify the location when he sees her on Friday.  I have asked her to prep with two enemas.  We will get a CEA as I do not see that this was checked locally or I do not have this report, and we will get a baseline chest x-ray.  I discussed with her if this reveals anything concerning, we will proceed to chest CT.  I discussed options for surgery including sigmoid resection versus low-anterior resection as it seems this is a distal sigmoid malignancy.  I do not suspect she will need a diversion with either of these procedures.  I discussed that her children will need screening colonoscopies at age 44 unless they develop symptoms earlier.
#2 Diverticulosis
She denies a history of diverticulitis.
#3 Indeterminate liver lesions
These are quite small, and I discussed with her we do not have a good modality to determine whether or not these appear to be metastatic disease or just simple cystic lesions.  I recommend that this be followed with scans in the future to make sure these are not changing with her malignancy.  Exact guidelines will be determined once she has her final pathology and lymph node status following surgery.
#4 Hypertension
Suboptimal control today, however, just recently started on blood pressure medicine.  We will get a CBC, BUN, creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels.  At this point will not change her medication, but this may need to be adjusted by her local provider.
#5 Obesity
#6 PAME
We will get a screening EKG and basic blood work and schedule POE nurse.
I will see Mrs. Merchant back on Friday with Dr. Singley following her testing.  All questions were answered.  She was seen with her husband.  Forty-five minutes spent.  Given laparoscopic colon handbook.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at HFCCS.
Code status discussion:  Discussed with Mrs. Merchant.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Merchant is seen at the request of Dr. Emig for evaluation of a sigmoid colon cancer.

Mrs. Merchant is a 54-year-old female from Bonner, who was undergoing her first colonoscopy screening for a three-month history of rectal bleeding and on April 13, 2010, was found to have a sigmoid colon cancer located approximately 20 cm from the anal verge.  Pathology has been reviewed here and confirmed invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  She has no family history of colorectal cancer.  She moves her bowels once or twice-a-day.  She has had intermittent problems with constipation in the past which has been stable for her.  She had noticed a little bit of rectal bleeding for the last three-months with wiping and was not overly concerned, and since her insurance did not cover her colonoscopy screening until now, she just recently decided to have a colonoscopy.  The tumor was described as a "semi-circumferential, scalloped mass lesion with a necrotic base."  The exact size was not mentioned.  This was tattooed both proximally and distally.  The prep was good.  She had some diverticula.  She denies recent fatigue.  She has not had significant weight-loss and denies abdominal or rectal pain.  She occasionally has perianal itching.  At times she feels irritation from hemorrhoidal prolapse but never has to manually reduce her hemorrhoids.  She denies fecal incontinence and has no history of anorectal procedures.
In regard to staging, she had a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on April 15, 2010, and we have reviewed those images.  This reveals a thickened distal sigmoid colon consistent with her malignancy.  There were some early pericolonic nodes noted.  She had some small, 2- to 3-mm low-attenuation lesions within the right lobe of the liver which were too small to characterize by CT and are indeterminate.  I discussed with Dr. Moore, the radiologist, and he says likely we can only follow these as they are too small for ultrasound and PET scan to determine exactly what they are.
