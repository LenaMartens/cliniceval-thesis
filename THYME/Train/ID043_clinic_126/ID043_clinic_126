Mrs. Clark had persistent tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Pathologic evaluation showed significant lymphatic involvement so that I am not sure whether the preoperative chemotherapy really was that effective.  However, patient is clearly at high-risk of tumor recurrence with distant metastasis so that we would normally recommend additional postoperative chemotherapy with a FOLFOX regimen.  At this point time, however, the patient's blood counts, in particular neutrophil counts, are low which would not allow us to initiate chemotherapy.  In fact, her white blood cell counts have fluctuated over the last several weeks after they had recovered initially after chemotherapy.  It is likely that a combination of prior pelvic radiation therapy for cervical cancer and chemotherapy and perhaps even the recent antibiotic therapy could have contributed to the neutropenia.  However, I would like to have this evaluated by our colleagues from Hematology likely with a bone marrow biopsy.  I plan to see Mrs. Clark back after the Hematology consultation then plan the definitive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
Mrs. Clark was content with the information she received.  All questions were answered.

Mrs. Clark is a very delightful 68-year-old patient who was diagnosed with an early-stage colon cancer in 2006.  Lower abdominal pain in April 2006 led to further workup which eventually included colonoscopy.  A tumor at the cecal pole was identified.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on June 16, 2006, did not show any sign of metastatic disease.  The patient was taken to the OR by Dr. Philip C. Primo, Colorectal Surgery at LCSHMC, on June 22, 2006.  He performed a resection of midileum en bloc with a right hemicolectomy for a cecal carcinoma with small-bowel attachment.  Pathology revealed a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated polypoid mass with maximum diameter of 5.8 cm in the cecum involving the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolonic mesenteric tissue but did not penetrate the small-bowel.  Forty-five regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor involvement.  DNA studies indicated the tumor was tetraploid.  The patient was subsequently enrolled in ECOG E5202 and, according to molecular parameters, assigned to the observation-only arm.
In February 2010, the patient noticed blood in her bowel movements. A colonoscopy on March 1, 2010 noted a mass in the mid-rectum, per EUS criteria classified as uT2N1. Since the patient had received prior pelvic radiation for a cervical cancer, neoadjuvant treatment was initiated with systemic chemotherapy alone in the form of mFOLFOX6.
The patient now returns to LCSHMC to be evaluated for surgery by Dr. Butler.  She has received three cycles of mFOLFOX6 until mid-April 2010, with relatively good tolerability except for fatigue and some hair loss.  She will also notice some cold-induced sensory neuropathies.  Treatment was also complicated by persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for which dose reductions of bolus 5-FU were performed.
Dr. Butler took the patient to surgery for an abdominal perineal resection on May 28, 2010.  Intraoperatively, a large tumor in the midrectum was found with a maximum diameter of 5.2 cm and invasion into the perirectal soft-tissue of the T3 lesion.  Six (of sixteen) lymph nodes were involved by tumor, no lymphatic or perineural invasion was found.  Final tumor stage was classified as ypT3, N2a.
The postoperative course was complicated by bowel obstruction for which the patient was briefly hospitalized and received antibiotics.
Mrs. Clark now returns to LCSHMC to potentially initiate postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.  Upon presentation, she stated that she had recovered well from her surgery.  She has no specific complaints.
