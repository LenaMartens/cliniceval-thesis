Apr-01-2010 16:47:31 - Modification to IMPRESSION / REPORT / PLAN, DIAGNOSIS by Tracy Holle

[end section id="20100"]

[start section id="20112"]

LABS
Hemoglobin 12.4.  Leukocytes 12.2.  Platelet count 216.  Sodium and potassium within normal range.  Glucose 138.  Creatinine 0.8.  Bicarb 20. C-reactive protein was 21.7, and CA125 was 50 on February 22, 2010.  Notably there was no CEA done.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Stage III TNM stage sigmoid colon cancer (T4, N2, with 6/32 regional lymph nodes involve by metastatic adenocarcinoma)
KRAS mutation status pending.
PLAN
The next step was discussed in detail with Mrs. Nance.  An approach would be to give FOLFOX therapy four to six-weeks from surgery provided there is an uneventful postoperative course.  After adequate time for wound healing, FOLFOX 6 regimen can be administered.  The side-effects of therapy including, but not limited to, mucositis, diarrhea, myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, infection, death were discussed with Mrs. Nance.  There is a low likelihood of alopecia less than 5% with this regimen.  In addition, she would require a port placement, and I would discuss with the primary team if this can be performed during her current admission. We would be also inclined to get her evaluated by a medical geneticist.  I do note that DNA mismatch repair enzyme immunohistochemical staining (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) showed intact expression of all four enzymes thereby suggesting that hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome is unlikely.  However based on her family history and multiple polyps, a few of which are dysplastic, other diagnoses such as attenuated familial adenomatosis polyposis could be entertained.  It would be worthwhile to get a consultation from medical geneticist, and we would arrange for that.  In addition, I would try to obtain a CEA level from the preoperative sample if possible, otherwise from todays' sample.  I have already asked the path lab to add KRAS mutation analysis which would be helpful with regard to future therapy with cetuximab.  If she is Wild type KRAS (absence of mutation) cetuximab would be a useful agent in future.  We would set-up an appointment with Medical Oncology in four to six-weeks.
The case was discussed extensively with Dr. Davis

Mrs. Nance is a very pleasant 42-year-old nurse from 52349 who underwent hand-assisted sigmoid resection with mid-rectal anastomosis on March 2, 2010, due to recent diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer.  She was diagnosed with colon cancer on a recent colonoscopy that demonstrated a nonobstructing tumor lesion in the sigmoid colon.  In addition, on that colonoscopy several polyps were found and in particular a sessile polyp in the ascending colon was suggestive of tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  Another tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia was found on mid-transverse colon.  Multiple other polyps were noted both in transverse colon, and there were areas of inflammatory reaction in the mucosa of sigmoid colon.  Most importantly, an ulcerating, fungating tumor was noted (at 20 to 23 cm) which showed an infiltrating grade 2/4 adenocarcinoma.  Her recent surgical resections were suggestive of pT3N2 lesion as an invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma was identified forming an ulcerative polypoid mass located 4.5-cm from rectal mucosal margin.  The tumor invaded through muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic vascular invasion was absent, and all surgical margins were negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A total of 21 cm of sigmoid colon and rectum were resected.
Presenting symptoms: Mrs. Nance had been noticing blood in her stool mixed with mucus for the last one-year along with a change in the caliber size of her stools for the last six-months.  In addition, she had been complaining of bloating for the last six-months.  She had an essentially negative CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on February 8, 2010.  There was no CEA level drawn.  She denies any fever, chills, loss of appetite, or weight-loss.  She denies any chest pain currently but was more recently evaluated with a treadmill stress test for a left shoulder pain.  Apparently she was cleared for surgery, although she did not complete the stress test due to elevated blood pressure and fatigue.
