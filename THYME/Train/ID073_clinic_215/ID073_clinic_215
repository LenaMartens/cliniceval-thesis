PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1. Age 17, diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
2. August 1985, hysterectomy, appendectomy, and partial small-bowel resection.
3. 1999, partial small-bowel resection.
4. April 4, 2005, partial small-bowel resection.
5. October 2009, colovaginal fistula.  On October 16, 2009, she had a diverting colostomy.  Unfortunately, the stricture was resected, and the pathology reported as a rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma.  The tumor was not totally resected.
6. October 28, 2009 - December 8, 2009, radiation therapy of 5040 rads in 28 fractions over 42 days.  Xeloda was given during this.
7. February 3, 2010, attempted resection of the rectal stump, but the surgeon states that "there was tumor in the proximal to mid rectum adherent to the left pelvic side wall and what appeared to be the base of the bladder near the left ureter.  I could not find a dissection plane in that region to safely proceed.  There were extensive adhesions in the pelvis which radiated to small-bowel.  There was a rent in the dome of the bladder that was repaired in two layers with Monocryl."
Patient was therefore sent to the Carroll Medical Clinic.  Overall, she is feeling well.  In the past few days, she has noted some bloody mucus being passed from her rectum.

Abdomen:  Colostomy but otherwise negative.Lungs:  Clear.Heart:  Regular sinus rhythm.Skin:  Examined and normal.Rectum:  I could not perform exam as this was painful.Reports:  No laboratory tests were done here.  Slides are being reviewed.  I have reviewed her March 4, 2010, outside CT-scan with Dr. Earl Bryant.  It does show a mass at the proximal end of the rectal stump which may be stuck or communicating with small-bowel.  There does not appear to be evidence of distant spread.Pelvis:  Vaginal exam--I felt no mass.Lymph:  Nodes nonpalpable.General:  Thin woman in no acute distress.
