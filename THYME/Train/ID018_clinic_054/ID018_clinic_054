#1 Cecal adenocarcinoma, stage IIIC (pT4b, N1b, M0) status-post surgical resection
#2 Elevated liver enzymes
#3 Acute renal failure, improving
I discussed with Mr. Vanguilder and his family his colon cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  Also discussed indications, alternatives, general logistics, and potential toxicities of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy treatment.  At this time, given his current situation of rising liver enzyme abnormalities and renal function that has not returned to baseline, he would not be able to safely start adjuvant chemotherapy.  However, he is only one-month out from surgery, and he could certainly be monitored in the next one-to-two months' time, that if he makes adequate recovery adjuvant systemic chemotherapy would certainly be considered for his stage of colon cancer, despite his senior age of 79.  In this setting we know that  in other patients without significant comorbidity that can tolerate adjuvant chemotherapy, there is a benefit to systemic adjuvant chemotherapy despite advanced age.  This may be in the form of 5-FU or capecitabine without the oxaliplatin.  However, this will need to be assessed as he makes his recovery.  This was discussed in extensive detail with the patient and family.  They do live closer to the WIC Hospital and prefer to establish care there.  I suggested that they make an appointment in approximately two-weeks' time to establish care there.
With regard to the elevated liver enzymes, this appeared to be slightly abnormal at the time of hospital admission on October 3.  Then, on yesterday's laboratory check, the enzymes were elevated.  At this time, since the CT-scan does not show any major abnormalities in the liver, we would recommend holding the Zocor until the liver enzymes improve.  Would recommend rechecking liver enzyme tests in about two-weeks' time.  If they are improving, then no further action needs to be done other than monitoring.  Zocor can certainly be restarted when liver enzymes return to normal.  If the liver enzymes continue to rise, we would consider ultrasound of the liver and fractionating the alkaline phosphatase for further evaluations.  This can be done at the WIC Hospital.
Regarding the incidental finding of the left renal mass that was only seen on ultrasound on October 4, 2010, at this time we would recommend followup imaging in the future.  This was not seen on CT-scan today.  No further testing is necessary at this time.

Mr. Vanguilder is a very pleasant 79-year-old gentleman who presented today with his spouse and two daughters for evaluation of the above issue.  His oncologic history is as follows:
1.  August 8, 2010 - presented to the ER due to multiple days of dyspnea and subsequently developing chills.  At the emergency room, he was noted to have a hemoglobin of 5.5 with an MCV of 66.  He continued to experience respiratory distress and eventually was intubated.  Temperature was 38.2.  They then transferred him to Henderson Family County Health Department.  A CT-scan of the chest noted a tiny indeterminate pulmonary nodule of the right base adjacent to the diaphragm and mildly prominent subcarinal and right hilar lymph nodes.  There was mild effusion bilaterally and a left-sided pneumonia.  He was evaluated and noted to have a slowly increasing troponin level which was felt to be due to demand ischemia.
2.  August 9, 2010 - echocardiogram noted severe bi-atrial enlargement and aortic valve stenosis.  EGD noted three punctated ulcers in the antrum of the stomach with clean bases and two ulcers in the body of the stomach also with clean bases.
3.  August 18, 2010 - colonoscopy performed to the cecum noting a large cecal mass extending into the ascending colon.  This encompassed 50% of the circumference of the colon.  The area was hard and ulcerated.  It was biopsy positive for invasive poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  A rectal polyp was removed and noted to be a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  The cauterized resected margin was focally positive for adenoma.  CEA was 1.3.
4.  September 14, 2010 - Dr. Wolf performed a right hemicolectomy.  Per operative report, the tumor had become locally advanced and had grown into the abdominal sidewall near its junction with the retroperitoneum on the right.  Enlarged nodes at the ileocolonic vascular pedicle.  The cecal tumor had grown outside the cecum into the body wall and had caught a loop of ileum, which was proximal to the ileocecal valve.  There was no obvious metastatic disease in the abdomen.  Not able to feel much of the liver as the right upper quadrant was obliterated by adhesions.  Pathology of the right hemicolectomy tissue was positive for poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a polypoid mass in the cecum.  The tumor directly invaded through the serosa and into the muscularis propria of the adjacent ileum.  Lymphatic invasion was focally present.  Surgical resected margins were negative.  Of 24 regional lymph nodes removed, 2 were positive for metastatic disease.  Tumor was identified within the lumen of a vein in the mesentery.  The abdominal wall excision was involved by adenocarcinoma (pT4, N1).
5.  October 3 to October 14, 2010, posthospitalization course was complicated by admittance to La Clinica del Norte Memorial Nursing Home from Dahl Medical Center of Manchester for hyperkalemia due to high ostomy output and resultant acute renal failure from ATN injury.
Mr. Vanguilder returns today for followup.  He is currently still staying at Dahl Medical Center of Manchester.  He does report that he had noticed that his ostomy output is becoming more formed.  He is also gaining energy.  His appetite is improving as well.  He denies any shortness-of-breath or chest pain.  He continues to have wound dehiscence, mainly at the caudal and pedal edges of the incision which is being cared for at the nursing home.

Per prior notation, he is a htuzdzp largzx who prior to his hemicolectomy lived independently in TX, WA.  He is a former smoker with 20-pack-year history, quit 43 years ago and prior to this illness, he stated he drank approximately 2 whiskey drinks per week.
