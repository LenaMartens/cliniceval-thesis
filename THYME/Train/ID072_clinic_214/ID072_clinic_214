Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Terry Montana' Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Cory Zepeda, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Preoperatively had had a discussion with Mrs. Webb that more than likely we would be recommending further chemotherapy.  I did reassure her that even though there was more than what we suspected, at this time, Dr. Montana believes that he has removed all viable disease, for sure all visible disease.  Again, I do not have pathology reports to ascertain margins and such but informed her that no matter what we would be looking at, chemotherapy following this procedure.  I stated that if there is no other evidence of any disease recurrence, in approximately one-month's time would proceed with approximately six-months worth of adjuvant therapy.  I did inform her, however, that a more definite plan will be made when she is up and allowed an appropriate recovery, typically four weeks.  I will make arrangements for her to return at that time with comprehensive lab tests and imaging studies.  They deny any further questions at this time.  They have our telephone number to contact us should they have any further questions or concerns.

Mrs. Webb is a pleasant 72 year-old woman from Memphis Decatur.  I am seeing her today at the request of Dr. Montana' surgical service to discuss the surgical findings and the recommendations subsequently.  For comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated November 3, 2009.  Briefly, her history is as follows.
Her history is as follows:
1. February 4, 2008, exploratory surgery performed in Illinois where the surgeon states there was a mass that was fractured off the psoas muscle that left behind extension of tumor in the retroperitoneum.  He did remove the entire mesentery of the right colon.  Further exploration revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon as well as an additional retroperitoneal mass.  Pathology of the right peritoneal and left pelvic peritoneum positive for adenocarcinoma.  Right colon with the adherent right ovary was positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma located at the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades into the pericolonic adipose tissue.  One of 14 pericolonic lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma.  Ovary is negative.
2. Sigmoid colon tissue was positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Tumor invades into the pericolonic adipose tissue.  Negative margins.  No lymph nodes removed from this region.
3. April 17, 2008, Dr. Montana performed an en bloc resection of the persistent psoas muscle mass as well as a portion of the small-bowel.  Pathology positive for grade 3 (of 4) colonic adenocarcinoma.  All visible disease removed.
4. June 6, 2008, through October 6, 2008, treated with FOLFOX plus Avastin therapy at her local facility.  Avastin was withheld until July at which time this was added.  Did require dose modification due to myelosuppression.
5. October 16, 2008, PET CT noting PET-positive soft-tissue within the left abdomen, most prominent near the sutures of the anastomosis of the colon.  This was worrisome for local recurrent disease.  Scattered increased activity throughout the residual left-side of the colon, rectosigmoid colon and small-bowel.  Majority appeared to be physiological activity.  CEA was increasing.
6. October 20, 2008, through December 10, 2008, FOLFIRI plus Erbitux therapy was administered.  Was treated with four treatments.
7. December 16, 2008, PET CT noting no evidence of new distant metastatic disease.  Moderate reduction in the focal uptake at the ileocolonic anastomosis.
8. January 5, 2009, colonoscopy noting ileotransverse anastomosis with mild stenosis as well as anastomosis at the rectosigmoid area.  Polyp removed from the sigmoid area positive for hyperplastic polyp.
9. January 6, 2009, Dr. Montana performed exploratory laparotomy as well as resection of the ileocolonic anastomosis.  Pathology for the anastomosis excision is negative for malignancy.
10. February 24, 2009, PET CT noting increased uptake at the ileocolonic anastomosis, which is most likely postoperative.
11. May 4, 2009, August 4, 2009, November 3, 2009, CT test negative for disease recurrence.
12. May 3, 2010, CT abdomen and pelvis noting indeterminate soft-tissue thickening in the anterior abdominal wall.  This is more prominent than it appeared on prior studies.  A second similar-appearing area of soft-tissue thickening slightly lower on the right anterior abdominal wall musculature.
13. May 4, 2010, ultrasound-guided biopsy of the abdominal wall mass is positive for malignancy, adenocarcinoma.
14.  Dr. Montana performed abdominal exploration and resection of approximately 12 metastases.  At the time of consultation there is no operative report or pathology available.  This is per Dr. Montana' verbal report to me.  He states there was two dominant abdominal masses, one appearing to be constricting this in the peritoneum.  He states that there was no evidence of any carcinomatosis and all viable disease was resected.
Today, Mrs. Webb is one-day postoperative.  She is a bit drowsy, however there are two other family members present during this consultation.
