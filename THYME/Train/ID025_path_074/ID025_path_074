Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right ascending, resection:  Moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 7.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm ulcerative, annular mass in the ascending colon which infiltrates through the muscularis propria and pericolonic adipose tissue and focally penetrates the visceral peritoneum.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is identified.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor (6.0 cm, closest margin, terminal ileal margin.  The appendix is involved by a sessile serrated adenoma.  Multiple 3 (of 13) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  With available surgical material AJCC pT4 N1b.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 4.5 cm of terminal ileum, 21.0 cm of colon, and a 5.5 x 1.3 cm appendix.  A 7.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm ulcerative annular mass is present within the ascending colon,1.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The mass is 6.0 cm from the terminal ileum mucosal margin.  The appendical lumen contains mucin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by RILEY.




Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, right ascending, excision:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, infiltrating through the muscularis propria and penetrates the visceral peritoneum.  Hold over to assess lymph nodes on permanent sections.  Benign appendical mucinous proliferation.  Hold over to further classify.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lloyd S. Rivera, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Vinny Shoup, immunohistochemical stains for mismatch repair proteins are performed.  Tumor cells show intact (normal) expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.
