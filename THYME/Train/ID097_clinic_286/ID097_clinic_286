Mr. Dorn has been okay anesthesia by Cardiology and they do not need to see him for Okay-A for his rectal cancer. Please refer to Cardiology note of 27 April 2010 by Ms. Munoz, P.A.-C. This note we were asked to refer to and Cardiology does not feel there is a need for them to see Mr. Dorn and state he is okay anesthesia. This was done over the telephone by my clinical assistant.
IMPRESSION

See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Mccoy who also met with Mr. Dorn and his wife.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient scheduled for blood work including CEA and INR, chest x-ray, ECG, CT abdomen and pelvis, rectal ultrasound.  I asked them to biopsy the lesion, stage the lesion, and tattoo 1-cm below the lesion if possible.  FNA if indicated as well.

#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Dorn is a 73-year-old male who had a colonoscopy yesterday outside of the Columbus Foot Hospital, and a rectal mass approximately 5-cm from the anal verge was noted and biopsied.  Biopsies read elsewhere showed adenocarcinoma.  Colonoscopist made it to the ileal cecal valve, and other than diverticulosis, no other abnormal findings were found.  Patient has a history of low-anterior resection for a rectal cancer in 2002.  He did not receive any chemo-radiation pre- or postoperatively.  The surgical report, pathology report is included in outside records, and there were four negative nodes.  He was followed with colonoscopies at one-year postoperation, two years, and the last in 2004 which colonoscopy was negative.  He was lost to surveillance apparently because of a mixup in names.  The last several weeks, Mr. Dorn has had some rectal bleeding with some blood on the toilet paper and on the bowel movement.  This led to colonoscopy as mentioned above.  He denies abnormal weight-loss.  Has a good appetite.  No bowel habit changes.
