Mr. Martin recently underwent resection of a large, locally advanced cancer of the colon in the splenic flexure.  The tumor actually showed some signs of perforation obstruction upon pathologic exam, and it spread into the omentum.  One peritumoral lymph node was directly involved by tumor invasion.  Additional 25 lymph nodes were negative for tumor involvement.  Eventually the tumor was characterized as a pT4, N0 stage.  A CT-scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any definitive signs of organ metastasis.  The patient does have small indeterminate pulmonary nodules which I would, however, not consider relevant enough for us to guide any therapeutic approach at this point in time.
I reviewed all these findings with Mr. Martin and his family via an interpreter.  The patient is clearly in a high-risk stage II situation which would qualify him for its treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy.  The standard of care would be an oxaliplatin-based regimen with either 5-FU or capecitabine as a combination partner.  The patient will pursue further oncologic care in Dayton, and I gave him the address of one of the colorectal cancer specialists in Corpus Christi Dr. Bernard Tatum in Waynesburg.  We briefly outlined potential side-effects of this treatment including but not limited to myelosuppression, high-risk of infection, neuropathy, diarrhea, constipation, and mucositis.  The patient voiced understanding.  He is aware of the fact that he would require to start chemotherapy within the next four to eight weeks.
Mr. Martin was content with the information he received.  All questions were answered.

Mr. Martin is a very pleasant 68-year-old patient from Aaron, who was recently-diagnosed with an obstructing and perforating colon cancer.  His oncologic history is well-outlined in Colp' note which I reviewed and agree with.
