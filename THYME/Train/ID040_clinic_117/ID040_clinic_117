#1 Metastatic colon cancer to the liver, unresectable liver disease
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Benton service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Martinez, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Mr. Graves is an established patient of our colleagues in APO New York, Missouri, Ochsner Hospital Seabrook.  He will be following-up with them, and therefore, I will not have him return postoperatively.  Dr. Martinez will visit with Mr. Graves prior to hospital dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  Certainly, if the need arises in the future, I would be more than happy to help facilitate care.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

I was asked by Dr. Harper's service to visit with Mr. Graves for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Graves is a very pleasant 53-year-old male from Norway Missouri.  He is an established patient of our colleagues in the Methodist Memorial Hospital in APO New York.
1.  December 2009 - underwent screening colonoscopy which identified a sigmoid mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  CEA was 79.4.  PET/CT showed bilobar liver metastases.
2.  December 2009 to August 2010 - underwent FOLFOX plus Avastin x12 cycles.  Had significant peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet with some functional impairment with difficulty buttoning buttons and tying shoes from oxaliplatin exposure.  Interval imaging showed disease response.
3.  August 2010 - evaluated with a repeat CT and MRI showing several lesions in the liver, some of which were smaller and some of which were larger.  Patient seen by Drs. Blair Solomon and Pemberton and the consensus was to undergo primary resection of the colon cancer and a staged liver resection.
4.  September 10, 2010 - underwent sigmoid resection by Dr. Harper.  Surgical pathology noted a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming 4.1-cm x 3.2-cm x 0.7-cm mass in the sigmoid colon invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat with minimal treatment effect.  The surgical margins were negative, and 1 of 15 regional lymph nodes was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Biopsy of the left lobe of the liver was consistent with metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Due to the extensive disease in the liver, Dr. Solomon was unable to proceed with planned hepatic resection and liver disease was left in place.
Mr. Graves is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
