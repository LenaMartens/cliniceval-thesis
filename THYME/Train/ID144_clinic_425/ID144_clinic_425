I reviewed the patient's pathology, operative report, and colonoscopy.  I agree with Ms. Henderson's assessment.  This is a T3, N2, M0 carcinoma of the colon with 13 out of 45 lymph nodes positive.  I explained the significance of this to the patient and explained that, with stage 3 colon cancer, we would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy.  Standard chemotherapy oftentimes involves FOLFOX, but for people at the age of 77, consideration would be given to single-agent adjuvant capecitabine or 5-FU leucovorin only.  I described how the chemotherapy is given as an outpatient, intravenously, and talked about the side-effects of treatment with the patient.  His wife was present throughout all of this and took notes.  The patient is from Vermont and plans to return there.  I have recommended that they hook up with a local oncologist and arrange for treatments according to his status in about four to six-weeks.  I have given them my card so they know they can call me if they have any further questions.  The oncologist they select can also contact me if he so wishes.
