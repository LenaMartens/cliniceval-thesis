Final Diagnosis
A.  Descending colon with small bowel, resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming an 8.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm mass in the descending colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and directly invades other organs or structures (small bowel wall).  There is a prominent foreign body reaction within the small bowel.  Lymphatic vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 11) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N1b] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Terminal ileum, ascending colon and appendix are without diagnostic abnormality.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""descending colon with small bowel"" is a left hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 1.5 cm in length portion of colon with an 8.0 cm portion of small bowel.  There is an 8.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm polypoid nearly annular mass within the descending colon 0.3 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends through the muscle into small bowel.  Lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ASHTON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""ascending transverse colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 8.0 cm of terminal ileum, 3.7 cm of colon, and a 6.5 x 0.5 cm appendix.  No mass is present.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ASHTON.



Addendum Diagnosis
Given the morphology of the lesion as well as the patient's age, immunohistochemical studies for DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1 were performed on the descending colon tumor.  There is aberrant loss of expression of MSH2 and MSH6 within the malignant cells.  Internal positive control staining is present.  MLH1 and PMS2 expression is intact within the neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells.  The findings are diagnostic of defective DNA mismatch repair due to MSH2 loss.  Confirmation of germline versus somatic abnormality will require mutation analysis.
