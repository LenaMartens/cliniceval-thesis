#1 Lower-extremity weakness
Our evaluation of the lower-extremity weakness was not complete.  We were unable to arrange for Neurology or EMG consultation during his short-stay.  He was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and we appreciate their evaluation.  They did give Mr. Trahan a referral for physical therapy and a strengthening program.
The finding as outlined below may have contributed to some of his weakness over the last many months.
#2 Type-2 diabetes mellitus
His control has been reasonable with an A1c of 7.1.  Will have him hold his diabetic medications the morning of his procedure.
#3 Hyperlipidemia
His lipids are reasonable at 103 on his current therapy.  He should hold the lipid medication the morning of his surgery.
#4 Benign prostatic hypertrophy with obstruction
We have given him a prescription for Flomax, 0.4 mg that he can take at nighttime to see if he will have improvement with decreased urination at night.  He will need to follow-up with his local clinician as far as further dose adjustment.
#5 Question of history of stroke
He had a questionable history of possible stroke some two years ago.  Further evaluation of this was not pursued at this time.  At a minimum, I would suggest he remain on an aspirin per day.  He has discontinued his Advil and plans to use an aspirin a day for prophylaxis in the future.  Further evaluation could be done when more time is allotted here or could be performed locally.
#6 Iron-deficiency anemia
#7 Probable colon cancer at the cecum with local lymph node involvement
Colonoscopy today did identify a large mass in the cecum that is ulcerating.  Most likely this appears to be a malignant mass in the cecum.  We went ahead and did a CT-scan of the abdomen this afternoon, and this does show some local enlarged lymph nodes suggesting local metastatic spread to the lymph nodes.  Dr. Ashley Gates was kind enough to see Mr. Trahan this afternoon and has offered surgery to Mr. Trahan to remove this section of colon.
Of note, Mr. Trahan's electrocardiogram and chest x-ray are unremarkable.  He relates to me that he was able to run two blocks just a couple of months ago without any shortness-of-breath or chest discomfort.  He should be okay for anesthesia for the purpose of removing this malignancy.
#99 Health-maintenance
Colonoscopy 2010.  PSA, 2010.  Lipids 2010.  Tetanus, he thinks was in 2007.  We did recommend a  pneumococcal immunization at some point.  He does not get influenza immunizations.
