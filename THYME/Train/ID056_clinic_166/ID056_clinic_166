#1 Stage IV colon cancer, completely resected
I have discussed with Mr. Duran the recommendation to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy with or without Avastin.  I explained to him that the purpose is to decrease recurrence of metastatic disease.  We discussed side-effects of FOLFOX chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, immune suppression, peripheral neuropathy, and cold intolerance, as well as Avastin including hypertension, proteinuria, and GI perforation.  Mr. Duran is eager to undergo adjuvant therapy but would like to have this done by his doctors at-home.  I encouraged him to call us with any further questions that he might have.
