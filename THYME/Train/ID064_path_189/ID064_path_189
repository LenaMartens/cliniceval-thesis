Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a circumferential mass (12.2 x 6.4 x 1.6 cm) located in the cecum at the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion identified. All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 14) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with soft tissue implants. [AJCC pT3N1bMX]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
