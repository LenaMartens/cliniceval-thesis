#1 Adjuvant therapy following resection of a rectal adenocarcinoma
Prior to meeting with Mrs. Becnel, I have had the opportunity to review her past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  At this time, I am quite pleased to inform her that surgical resection noted no evidence of any lymph node involvement.  Most of the pathology as well states that there is disease response to therapy.  Given Dr. Hancock recommendations back on April 12, 2010, would proceed with four months or eight treatments of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Per my later discussion with Dr. Samuelson, at this time we will omit the bolus 5-FU due to the fact that she has had mucositis as well as hand and food during her neoadjuvant therapy phase.  We will be having a Port-A-Cath placed by our colleagues in Interventional Radiology.  We will then plan to initiate chemotherapy the next week.
#2 Follow-up
I will plan to have Mrs. Becnel return approximately two-weeks after her first chemotherapy dose for reevaluation.  She denies any further questions or concerns.  She has our telephone number to contact us should she have any further questions or concerns.  I did review with her potential side-effects of the chemotherapy which could include but are not limited to cold sensitivity, neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, weight-loss, altered taste, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, elevated temperature, and infection.

Mrs. Becnel is a pleasant 58-year-old woman from 71016 Lancaster.  I am seeing her today in follow-up after undergoing resection of her locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.  Per Dr. Hancock note dated April 12, 2010, making treatment recommendations based on that.  Her oncology history is as follows:
1.  December 10, 2009:  Colonoscopy revealed a mass 10-cm from the anal verge.  A biopsy revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. as well as a 3-cm polyp at 40 cm in the sigmoid.  This was completely removed by hot snare polypectomy; the pathology here describes moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising within the tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  The resection margins could not be evaluated from the specimen.
2.  January 6, 2010:  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the known rectal lesion extending for a distance of at least 4-cm.  No enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the perirectal fat; however, there was one slightly prominent, 1-cm, inferior mesenteric lymph node just anterior to the sacrum.  The remainder was negative.
3.  January 7, 2010:  Repeat colonoscopy up to the splenic flexure here at Indian River Hospital revealed a friable, ulcerated tumor 9-cm to 14 cm from the anal verge, T3 on EUS.  There were peritumoral lymph nodes, measuring 4-mm--indeterminate, and at 20 cm from the anal verge, there was a 5-mm indeterminate lymph node that was aspirated.  The cytology from this specimen was negative for malignancy.
4.  January 8, 2010:  Dr. Mccloskey recommended neoadjuvant therapy.  He felt she will likely need a coloanal procedure with a temporary diverting loop ileostomy.
5.  January 20, 2010:  Chemoradiation using 5-FU 225 mg/m2 per day IV continuous infusion.  The infusion was held February 2 to February 8 secondary to severe mouth ulcers.  Chemotherapy was discontinued on February 22, 2010, due to hand-foot syndrome.
6.  April 13, 2010, Dr. Mccloskey performed a laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal resection.  Pathology notes rare keratin-positive cells present within the submucosa.  There is evidence of an underlying area of mucosal ulceration which is status-post neoadjuvant therapy; prominent submucosal and subserosal fibrosis with a cellular mucin pool within the muscularis propria indicative of moderate tumor regression.  Separate biopsy site within the sigmoid colon shows no residual adenocarcinoma.  Of 27 regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for metastatic disease.
Today, Mrs. Becnel states that she is feeling relatively well.  Her only issue is the difficulties she is experiencing with her ostomy appliance.  She states that she has been having quite a bit of leaking requiring appliance replacement on a very frequent basis which is therefore breaking down her stomal tissue.  She has been talking to the manufacturers of the ostomy supplies who has been providing her recommendations.
She reports that her appetite has been very good, weight is stable; energy level has returned to near-normal.  She is planning to return-to-work after today's appointment, reports that the output from the ostomy site has been good, denies any blood or mucus in the output.  She denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
