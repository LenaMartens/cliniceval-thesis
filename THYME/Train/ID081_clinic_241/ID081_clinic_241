I was consulted intraoperatively for evaluation of a malpositioned catheter.  Flexible cystoscopy was undertaken which demonstrated a small area of potential false passage in the bulbar urethra which was covered with minimal clot.  The true lumen was seen at the 12 o'clock position, and a 14-French Silastic catheter was placed over a wire without difficulty.  This patient's urinary catheter should remain in place for seven to ten days following placement.  If the patient is still hospitalized at that point, the catheter can be removed on the floor.  Please check ultrasound postvoid residuals with a goal of less than 200 mL.  Alternatively if the patient is dismissed from the hospital, please contact Dr. Sanchez' secretary at (530-591-3798 to schedule a UCO/voiding trial.  The patient should otherwise follow-up with Dr. Sanchez in six-months' time per his last visit on April 16, 2010.  For questions or concerns, please page 260-951-02156.
