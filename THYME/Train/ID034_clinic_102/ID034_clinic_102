#1 Treatment recommendation following resection of a node-positive colon adenocarcinoma
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Greg Ruiz through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
I did review with Mr. Smith typical treatment schedules for aggressive chemotherapy treatment, not so aggressive therapy versus observation.  For treatment recommendations, please refer to Dr. Mendenhall subsequent supervisory note.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at CDSSRBH.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.
ADDITION
I have contacted Mr. Smith's primary-care provider, Dr. Pray, to inform her that his creatinine is elevated at 2.4.  At this time, she has recommended alter his diuretic therapy; informed patient it has been recommended that he take his Lasix (furosemide) only once-daily for the next three days; recommend having a repeat blood test done Thursday, and Dr. Pray will follow-up with the patient.  These tests have been ordered.  Patient stated full understanding with this plan.

Mr. Smith is a pleasant 86-year-old gentleman from Sale City Pennsylvania. We are seeing him today to discuss treatment recommendations following resected node-positive adenocarcinoma.  His oncology history is as follows:
1.  August 12, 2010:  Admitted to the hospital with weakness, leg pain, and tiredness; at that time was found to be anemic, and hemoglobin 6.4; underwent blood transfusions.
2.  August 31, 2010:  Return to see primary-care provider with similar complaints, at that time recommending further work-up that would be difficult to perform as an outpatient, and patient was therefore admitted to the hospital.
3.  September 1, 2010:  Colonoscopy performed to the ileal cecal valve noting sigmoid diverticulosis as well as a polyp in the descending/sigmoid colon.  The polyp was positive for tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  At the hepatic flexure, an ulcerated mass was identified that was biopsied.  This was positive for invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly-differentiated.
4.  September 2, 2010:  CT abdomen and pelvis noting abnormal mural thickening at the hepatic flexure; malignant adenopathy in the adjacent mesentery, retroperitoneum, right iliac chain, and Foramen of Winslow.  There is interstitial thickening of the lower lungs, possibly from edema or fibrosis.  CEA was noted to be 4.1
5.  September 15, 2010:  Dr. Hutchinson performed a right hemicolectomy.  The pathology was positive for undifferentiated, grade 4 (of 4), adenocarcinoma that extended through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat.  All surgical resected margins are negative.  Of 15 regional lymph nodes removed, 8 were positive for metastatic disease.  Microsatellite instability testing notes instability in five of five informative markers (pT3, pN2).
Today, Mr. Smith states that he feels the best he has in several years.  His main complaints are feeling cold and altered taste.  Patient states that he does remain well-hydrated, drinking plenty of fluids.  He has lost over 22 pounds since the summer, reports that he has lost approximately 1 pound over the last two-weeks; states that food does not taste like it had previously, does think that this is improving, also reports some early satiety.  He denies any nausea or vomiting.  He reports that his energy level has certainly increased, stating that he is doing activities now that he has not been able to do for quite some time.  Reports that he has a daily bowel movement that is absent of any blood or mucus; patient reports that he has frequent urination, unable to quantify how many times he uses the bathroom; states that he does get up in the middle of the night to urinate.  He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
