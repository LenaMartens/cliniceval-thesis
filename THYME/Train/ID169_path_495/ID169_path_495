Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid, rectum and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Poorly differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (4.0 x 3.7 x 0.8 cm) located in the rectum, at the dentate line and 3.2 cm from the anal skin margin.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  A serrated adenoma (0.7 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm) is also identified 1.8 cm proximal to the main tumor.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.3 cm, radial margin).  Multiple (26) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
