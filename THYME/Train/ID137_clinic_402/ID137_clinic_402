Reviewed outside colonoscopy report.
IMPRESSION
#1 Rectal cancer
I discussed the development, staging, and treatment of rectal cancer with Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  At this time, will proceed with staging chest x-ray, CT abdomen and pelvis, and endoscopic ultrasound.  The distal margin of the malignancy should be tattooed.  We discussed the need for chemoradiation if T3 or N1 disease is noted.  An Enterostomal Therapy consultation will be obtained for a diverting loop ileostomy education.  The patient will then meet with Colorectal Surgery for our recommendations.  She is referred specifically to Dr. Tomasini.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, the patient is okay for anesthesia.
Discussed with Chris Presnell.  Note to follow.

Mrs. Smith is a 48-year-old woman referred for treatment of rectal cancer.  She was noted to be anemic in November, and started passing blood per rectum in December.  She also noted more abdominal "gurgling" and narrowed bowel movements with alternating constipation and diarrhea.  Her first colonoscopy March 3, 2010, was positive for a-1-cm sigmoid colon polyp (tubular adenoma low-grade dysplasia) and a rectal mass at 10-cm (invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma).  Pathology results are confirmed by Ottumwa Regional Memorial Medical Center.  No staging studies have been performed to-date, and her bleeding has resolved.
Comorbidities include hypertension an diabetes mellitus for which she uses medication.  Her only previous surgery was pilonidal cyst treatment at age 18 and cholecystectomy with tubal ligation in 1991.  There is no history of heart attack, stroke, bleeding disorder, anesthesia reaction, medication allergy, sleep apnea, or thrombosis.  She does not smoke.
