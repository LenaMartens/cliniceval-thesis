#1 Rectosigmoid cancer
I informed Dr. Settles that our evaluation of rectal cancer involves undergoing an endoscopic rectal ultrasound, CEA, and since he has indeterminate lesions in the liver on his CT-scan, a liver ultrasound.  I will see him back with Dr. Leslie Harrison following his testing.  I discussed the possibility of needing neoadjuvant therapy with chemoradiation prior to surgery.  However, this will be the decision of Dr. Harrison following his endoscopic ultrasound and other testing.  I told him in general, colorectal cancer is usually treatable but may require multimodality therapy.  He would like to get an opinion, if Dr. Harrison feels it is indicated for him to have neoadjuvant therapy, by our medical and radiation oncologists here.  Discussed with him that his daughter should start screening colonoscopies at age 50.  Discussed TNM staging of rectal cancer and the need for tattooing.  I discussed with him at this point in reviewing his outside colonoscopy report I do not feel we need to repeat his full colonoscopy here and he is comfortable with this.
#2 Snoring
There was concerns from his wife who is an RN of obstructive sleep apnea.   We will obtain an overnight oximetry study to screen as eventually he will need to undergo surgery.
#3 Indeterminate pulmonary nodules
Discussed with him that these are too small to highlight on PET and too small to biopsy.  Likely these will need to be monitored with serial CT scans.
#4 Indeterminate liver lesions
We will obtain a liver ultrasound.
#5 PAME
We will get an EKG and basic blood work.  I do not feel further evaluation at this time is indicated.
#6 Heartburn
This is intermittent and not overly concerning.  He is using Zantac as-needed.
#7 Hyperlipidemia
He is not currently on treatment.
#8 Right knee osteoarthritis
He would like a second opinion; however, after putting in the order for this, May 12 was our first available consultation.  He has decided to cancel this for now.  He brought his outside x-rays.  He will hold on to these for now and we will not have them reviewed.  He is comfortable with this plan.
Spent 70 minutes with Dr. Settles.  All questions were answered.  He was seen with his ex-wife.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, but would like additional information. Advance Directive information packet provided to the patient. KM8837-84, MJ1093-20, MP5728-01, TK4559-47.
Code status:  Dr. Settles would like to be a full code.

Dr. Settles is seen for a surgical opinion regarding rectal cancer.

Dr. Settles noticed minimal bleeding after bowel movements for approximately one-week before he was scheduled for his first screening colonoscopy on March 11, 2010.  He had also noticed slightly narrowed stools for a short time. His colonoscopy was completed to the cecum with good prep and revealed mild diverticula in the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.  He denies a history of diverticulitis.  He had a large apple core lesion 4 to 5-cm in size at the rectosigmoid, at 10-cm from the anal verge.  Pathology slides have been reviewed here and confirm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  He has no family history of colorectal cancer.  He denies abdominal pain, weight-loss, or new fatigue.  He moves his bowels typically once or twice-a-day and denies fecal incontinence.  His appetite has been stable.  He has had just a little bit of bleeding since prepping for the endoscopic rectal ultrasound yesterday. I had asked him to take MoviPrep in preparation for an endoscopic ultrasound today, and he had a little bleeding. His local labs from March 10, 2010, revealed a hemoglobin of 14 with a hematocrit of 41.7. He has not seen a surgeon locally and has come directly here for an opinion.  An outside CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained and has been reviewed here revealing colonic narrowing and wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction consistent with his malignancy.  He had no lymphadenopathy.  He had two small indeterminate low-attenuation lesions in the right hepatic lobe and an ultrasound was recommended for further evaluation.  He had colonic diverticulosis.  He also had two tiny indeterminate nodules in the lower lungs, one less than 4-mm in size.  One was in the right lung base and the other in the left lower lung.  He had nodular enlargement of the right thyroid lobe mentioned.
While he is here, Dr. Settles would like to get an orthopedic surgeon opinion regarding right knee osteoarthritis involving the medial compartment.  He was seen by a local surgeon in February who discussed medial compartment arthroscopy versus total knee arthroscopy.  He would like to get a second opinion at Leonard Medical and Surgical Center.  He feels his gait is altered.  He has more of a wide stance when he walks from his knee discomfort.  When he is moving he has pain rating a 3 to 4 generally but does not take medication.  Getting out of a car is quite uncomfortable with him.  He also has mild discomfort in the left knee but the right knee bothers him the most.  He has had x-rays done locally which he has brought with him.

3.  History of TB exposure in 1984 via a patient.  He has had subsequent positive PPDs but has never been diagnosed with active TB.

6.  Hyperlipidemia.  From March 10, 2010, he had a total cholesterol of 234, triglycerides of 130, an HDL 54, and an LDL of 154.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Right inguinal hernia repair at age 7.
2.  Biopsy of either the lymph node or the parotid gland on the right-side which was benign, mid-1990s.
3.  Excision of solitary lesion of the left lung due to histoplasmosis which was benign, 1996.
