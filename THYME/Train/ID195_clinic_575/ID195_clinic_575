#1 Resected T4N1 adenocarcinoma of the colon
With T4a disease due to penetration to the surface of the visceral peritoneum, plus 2 involved regional lymph nodes, he has stage IIIB disease. We would typically recommend adjuvant FOLFOX (+/- Avastin) in this setting. I have met with the patient and outlined the timing of the FOLFOX regimen. I have explained the need for a Port if infusional 5FU is to be given. I also provided him with a verbal and written description of chemotherapeutic side-effects from 5FU and oxaliplatin.
As stated by our colleagues in Gastroenterology, the patient should, after an appropriate amount of time for post-operative healing, undergo another colonoscopy to rule-out synchronous lesions in the proximal colon.
Please see my consultant's notes for final recommendations. We may also ask our colleagues in pathology to perform kras mutation analysis on the tumor to see if EGFR-directed agents might play in a role in future lines of treatment. He plans on basing his oncologic care in California but has yet to select a specific provider.
Finally, please note that the patient's tumor analysis did reveal aberrant loss of MLH1 and PMS2 with intact expression of MSH2 and MSH6.  These findings confirm defective DNA mismatch repair due to loss of MLH1 expression with secondary loss of PMS2. However, the patient has no family history consistent with a hereditary cancer syndrome.

The patient is a 53-year-old male with the following clinical history:
1) In May 2010, the patient develops bright-red blood per rectum, which becomes progressively intermixed with his stools. He also develops intermittent upper abdominal pain.  In July, his local doctors in California found him to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 8.3. On July 20th, colonoscopy showed a mass in the distal transverse colon beyond which the endoscopist could not pass.
2) On July 22nd, the patient presented to Queen Medical Plaza seeking definitive treatment. CT abdomen/pelvis on the same date showed "a circumferential mass involving the transverse colon over a length of approximately 8-cm. The mass extends into the pericolonic fat, probably involving the gastrocolic ligament, transverse mesocolon and greater omentum. Several prominent pericolonic lymph nodes are seen, suspicious for metastatic adenopathy. The largest measures only 7-mm in short axis diameter. No other adenopathy is identified. The mass abuts proximal jejunum but there is no evidence of jejunal invasion. There is no bowel obstruction at this time. Negative for hepatic metastatic disease."
3) On July 23rd, colonoscopy at Gothenburg Dental Hospital showed a large transverse colon mass with near-complete obstruction (there was a very small opening between the normal bowel wall and the tumor, which allowed for flow of liquid toward the colonoscope). Biopsy showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, but the exact depth of invasion could not be determined.
4) On July 27th, the patient proceeded to the operating room under the guidance of Dr. Harris for an extended right hemicolectomy. Surgical pathology was as follows: "Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming an 8.0 x 7.0 x 2.7-cm annular mass in the transverse colon, 2.5-cm from the distal mucosal margin. Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat and focally penetrates the visceral peritoneum.   Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  Multiple (2 of 13) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma. With available surgical material [AJCC pT 4a N1] (7th edition, 2010)."

Upon interview, the patient confirms the above clinical history. He was in his usual state of health until this spring when he began to notice the GI blood loss. He became more flatulent but did not have any obvious changes in stool caliber. He was more tired than usual and unintentionally lost 12 lbs. over a 3-4-month period. His colonoscopy on July 20th was the first one of his lifetime.
