#1 History of resected stage III colon adenocarcinoma
Mrs. Lincoln is recovering reasonably well from her hemicolectomy for colon adenocarcinoma.  Her tumor was a T2, N1, M0 (stage III cancer), and was grade 4 by histology.  We discussed at length prognosis and the risk and benefits of chemotherapy.  We discussed that if chemotherapy were to be considered, it would likely be with single-agent capecitabine for six-months and that this might reduce her risk of recurrence by approximately 7%.  Mrs. Lincoln is not interested in receiving chemotherapy at this time and would prefer rather to be followed by Dr. Hall.  I think that this is completely reasonable.  I would recommend clinical exam every three-months or so with blood work including CEA.  CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis could be performed initially every three to six-months for the first couple of years after which point they could be lengthened to once yearly.  Mrs. Lincoln understands and expresses agreement with the plan.  I have given her my card in case she has further questions or concerns.

I was asked by Dr. York's service to visit with Mrs. Lincoln for postoperative education purposes.
1.  January 21, 2010 - routine followup by Dr. Hall noted a hemoglobin of 5.4.  She was hospitalized and transfused.
2.  February 11, 2010 - colonoscopy was performed and showed a transverse colon mass.  Biopsies confirmed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
3.  February 17, 2010 - CT-scan showed IPMN in the pancreatic head as well as a transverse colon mass and small low-density lesions in the liver thought to be consistent with cysts.  Chest x-ray was negative.
4.  February 22, 2010 - taken by Dr. York for laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy with anastomosis.  Surgical pathology showed grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerative polypoid 4.9-cm x 3.8-cm x 1.0-cm mass in the transverse colon invading into, but not through, the muscularis propria.  There were negative surgical margins, and 1 of 46 regional lymph nodes was positive for metastatic carcinoma.  The tumor was staged at a T2, N1, M0.
Mrs. Lincoln and her husband report for evaluation for stage III colon cancer.  She is recovering well from her laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy and anastomosis.  She still has some abdominal pain, but, otherwise, is near her baseline.  She does have longstanding paralysis most notable in her lower extremities as a results of transverse cervical myelitis.  She has chronic pain, numbness, and tingling in her feet and to a lesser extent in her fingers as well as bilateral leg and to a lesser extent arm, and core-muscle weakness.  Since her surgery, she has had no new areas of pain, no fevers, and no change in her bowel habits.  She has a bowel movement every couple of days which is at her baseline.
