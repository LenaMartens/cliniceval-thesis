#1 Recurrent rectal cancer
See history of present illness.  Discussed with Dr. Minaya, who also met with Mr. Haynes.  Please see his supervisory note.  Outside PET CT November 16, 2009, will be reviewed here.  I have ordered blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, CT abdomen and pelvis, PET CT, urine cytology, Medical and Radiation Oncology, and a visit with Dr. Dawn Divers, Colon and Rectal surgeon.  I have also ordered Hematology consult in regards to the factor V Leiden for any suggestions in case the patient is preop.  Patient is okay anesthesia from my estimation with no cardiopulmonary issues and he is physically active.

#1 Recurrent rectal cancer
Mr. Haynes is a 40-year-old male who was found to have rectal cancer in his late 30s.  He received preoperative chemoradiation therapy, followed by very low-anterior resection, followed by postoperative chemotherapy, followed by ileostomy closure.  He did well for approximately 2 1/2 years according to outside records until, on CT PET scan November 16, 2009, recurrent tumor in the right perirectal region was found.  Multiple biopsies failed to show recurrence until CT-scan-guided biopsy on December 29, 2009, showed infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  All tissue slides have been read here.  Testing for immunohistochemical staining was performed and this demonstrated the presence of normal protein expression.  Patient was seen closer to home by medical genetics and no clear familial syndrome or sign of genetic mutation suggesting a predisposition to malignancy was found.  There is no family history of cancers known to Mr. Haynes.  Patient now comes for entertainment of possible reoperation and intraoperative radiation therapy.   The patient's last colonoscopy was October 28, 2009.  It was essentially normal with anastomosis 3-cm from the anal verge.
