#1 Synchronous adenocarcinoma of the colon (pT4, N1, M0)
#2 Autosomal recessive MYH-associated polyposis syndrome
I was able to discuss with Mr. Ortiz and his wife today the pre-operative evaluation, the findings on pathology at the time of diagnosis, as well as the results of his Medical Genetics testing.  I was also able to discuss the case with Dr. Bowman today, who confirmed that he feels the more distal cancerous lesion that was removed was indeed a sigmoid and not a rectal lesion.
In this setting, I feel that we should treat with Mr. Ortiz as having stage III disease given two different T4 lesions and one positive lymph node.  On this note, we would utilize chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX every two-weeks times 12 cycles.  Given the more distal lesion was felt sigmoid in nature, we do not feel that radiation therapy would be indicated in this case.
This was all discussed at length with Mr. Ortiz and his wife.  They do plan to receive their chemotherapy care closer to home, and actually have an appointment with Dr. Boivin in Casselton already scheduled, and we informed them that they would be able to discuss the route, schedule of administration, and toxicities of the chemotherapy regimen to administered more fully at that time.
It is unclear exactly how Mr. Ortiz will respond to chemotherapy as patients with these MYH mutations are quite rare, and it is unknown what the efficacy of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is in these patients.  Regardless, we would recommend it, and I have expressed to Mr. Ortiz that we would be happy to see him back at GCGH at any point during his care for further evaluation.  At this time, he is unclear whether he would like to get imaging studies done at GCGH, in Casselton, or both.  I informed him that I would not schedule any follow-up at this time and leave him to have that conversation with Dr. Boivin in Casselton.  He and his wife expressed understanding and many informed questions were answered.
I have discussed this case at length with Dr. Kane who also saw and examined the patient.  Please see his note for further details.

Mr. Ortiz is a pleasant 42-year-old gentleman who was in his usual state of health prior to the last six to eight months when he began to experience dull, intermittent, right upper quadrant pain.  This was not overly problematic until midsummer of this year, and on July 5, 2010, he sought evaluation because of an increase in the pain as well as low-grade fevers.  Evaluation at this time in the local ED included a CT-scan which revealed a 7.5- x 5- x 5.6-cm mass in the cecum.  Subsequent colonoscopy performed in Casselton on July 13, 2010, showed a large, obstructing, ulcerating, partly necrotic mass in the midascending colon, an ulcerated infiltrating mass at approximately 15-cm from the anal verge as well as innumerable 1- to 3-mm polyps throughout the colon.  Biopsy of the two large, dominant, masses revealed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Biopsy of seven of these small polyps all revealed fragments of tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
Given these findings, Mr. Ortiz was referred to GCGH for further evaluation.  He was initially seen by our colleagues in Fredonia, who performed further staging, including a PET/CT which revealed hypermetabolic masses in the cecum as well as the sigmoid colon.  There was mild uptake in a pericecal lymph node and a tiny nodule in the right midlung without increased uptake.  A flexible sigmoidoscopy with transrectal ultrasound was also performed.  This revealed at least 30 small polyps in the left colon as well as a nodular ulcerated tumor from 14 to 18 cm from the anal verge, which was felt to be a T2 lesion by EUS.  There was also a concerning right common iliac node seen on EUS, and cytology from this specimen was negative for malignancy.  Further staging including an MRI of the pelvis which revealed a 4-cm plaque-like spreading lesion involving the distal sigmoid colon just proximal to the rectosigmoid junction which was not felt to have evidence of extraserosal extension.  Given his multiple polyps on colonoscopy, genetics testing was also performed, and Mr. Ortiz was found to have to have a biallelic Y165C mutation,  consistent with autosomal recessive MYH-associated polyposis.  Mr. Ortiz also had an upper endoscopy as part of his evaluation.  This revealed a single duodenal polyp which was removed via cold snare as well as slightly abnormal-appearing papilla.  Pathology review of these specimens revealed tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia in the polyp and reactive changes at the papilla without dysplasia.
Once staging was complete, Mr. Ortiz underwent a total proctocolectomy and ileostomy under the care of the Dr. Bowman on July 27, 2010.  There was much difficulty as the cecal lesion was found to be invading several loops of small-bowel as well as the abdominal wall.  Thus, it was converted to an open procedure.  A terminal ileostomy had to be placed given the quantity of small-bowel that had to be resected, which was approximately 2 feet.  Pathology review of this specimen revealed a 12.0 x 8.5 x 8.0 cm ulcerated and annular mass in the cecum, which was composed of grade 3 (of 4) mildly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The tumor invaded into the pericolonic fat and was adherent to the abdominal wall, but there was no viable tumor noted in this area of invasion.  There was no evidence of lymphatic invasion, and margins were negative.  Zero (of 21) regional lymph nodes were positive for tumor.  In the rectum, a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 ulcerative mass representing mildly differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma was noted.  This tumor was also found to penetrate the retroperitoneum.  Surgical margins were negative, but 1 (of 9) regional lymph nodes were positive.  There were greater then 50 polyps noted throughout the colon, and the final staging of this tumor was felt to be pT4, N1, M0.
Mr. Ortiz states that he has done relatively well since the time of surgery.  He states that he is having some rectal pain in the postoperative period and some irritation around his ileostomy, but otherwise feels well without fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, visual changes, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in his ostomy output, numbness, tingling, or focal neurologic symptoms.  He is having some mucus from his ostomy, and this has not changed in nature.  His ECOG performance status is 1.
