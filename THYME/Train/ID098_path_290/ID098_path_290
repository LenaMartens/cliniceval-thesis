Final Diagnosis
B.  Sigmoid, rectum, and anus, resection:  Recurrent grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a firm, whitish, mainly submucosal-based mass (4.4 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm) near the anus, less than 0.1 cm from the radial margin.  A second, more proximal (clinically presacral), yellow necrotic mass (5.0 x 2.8 x 2.7 cm) with central indwelling suture material represents fat necrosis.

C.  Peritoneum, left pelvic sidewall margin, excision:  Positive for recurrent, metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

A.  Peritoneum, right pelvic sidewall, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.
D.  Peritoneum, posterior pelvic margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.
E.  Peritoneum, deep left pelvic margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled right pelvic side wall tissue is a 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm fragment of fibrous pink-tan tissue.  All submitted. Grossed by ELLS.

B.  Received fresh labeled sigmoid, rectum, and anus is a 22.0 cm segment of atrophic colon with a portion of fragmented anus.  There is a 5.0 x 2.8 x 2.7 cm yellow necrotic mass at the superior aspect with central indwelling suture material.  There is a 4.4 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm firm white mass near the anus.  This mass is less than 0.1 cm from the radial margin at multiple aspects.  Grossed by ELLS.

C.  Received fresh labeled left pelvic sidewall margin is a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm portion of pink soft tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by RAYFORD.

D.  Received fresh labeled posterior pelvic margin is a 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm portion of pink-white soft tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by RAYFORD.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""deep left pelvic margin"" is a 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm portion of pink-tan soft tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by RAYFORD.





Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Leslie Burrell, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon tissue (block B1).  Upon completion, results will be available in UOIZ VnxeOlqa.
