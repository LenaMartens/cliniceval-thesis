#1 Permanent atrial fibrillation with severe atrial enlargement
#2 Systemic hypertension
#3 Coronary artery disease, status-post surgical revascularization

#8 Cecal adenocarcinoma, status-post right hemicolectomy
Mr. Burks has demonstrated intermittent increases in his heart rate and blood pressure following surgery.  We discussed potential mechanisms of worsening ventricular rate control with atrial fibrillation as well as elevated blood pressures in the postoperative setting and specifically potential implications of his surgery with respect to medication absorption.  He is currently without any symptomatic cardiopulmonary complaints.
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
1.  Obtain 12-lead electrocardiogram.
2.  Continue diltiazem 60-mg four times daily in lieu of long-acting diltiazem.
3.  Increase Losartan to 25-mg daily.
4.  Update electrolytes and creatinine; creatinine will need to be followed given increase in ARB.
5.  Continue monitoring heart rate and blood pressure.
6.  If Mr. Burks is to remain in the area following hospital dismissal, a 24-hour Holter monitor and six-hour ambulatory blood pressure can be performed with a follow-up in Dr. Vinny Salzer's outpatient clinic.
7.  Should the patient be dismissed and return home without cardiology follow-up here, he should be seen within one-week by either his primary-care physician or a local cardiologist to review hemodynamics.
8.  Coumadin has been reinitiated; the use of aspirin 81-mg daily needs to be discussed on an outpatient basis given Mr. Burks's coronary artery disease.
Discussed in detail with the patient and his son, and I believe all questions were answered.  The above recommendations were discussed with Dr. Salzer.  Please contact the Cardiology Service if his heart rate and blood pressure remain elevated or if we can be of further assistance prior to Mr. Burks's dismissal.
Addendum:  ECG reviewed. Increase diltiazem to 90 mg four times daily if heart rate remains elevated (only one dose of diltiazem administered today prior to the ECG).

Atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

Mr. Burks is an 83-year-old male with longstanding permanent atrial fibrillation; coronary artery disease, status-post surgical revascularization; peripheral arterial disease with lower-extremity claudication; multiple cardiovascular risk factors (systemic hypertension and dyslipidemia); severe obstructive pulmonary disease with emphysema; and recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the cecum.  Mr. Burks underwent open right hemicolectomy and ileotransverse colostomy on October 14, 2010.  He has done reasonably well following surgery.  He is complaining of intermittent hiccups and difficulty having a bowel movement.  Due to an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, the Cardiology Service was asked to provide additional recommendations.
Mr. Burks denies any chest discomfort, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema, lightheadedness, palpitations, or syncope.  He reports monitoring his blood pressure at-home on a frequent basis (three times daily).  His morning systolic blood pressure typically exceeds 160 mm Hg and averages between 120 to 130 mm Hg throughout the remainder of the day.  He reports his resting heart rate at-home is around 90 beats per minute.  His recorded heart rates over the past several days are typically between 90 and 100 beats per minute.  Over the past 36 hours, he has recorded heart rates of up to 120 beats per minute.  His systolic blood pressure has consistently been greater than 140 mm Hg and earlier this morning was 168 mm Hg.  He has undergone several modifications to his cardiovascular medical regimen as an outpatient in the weeks leading up to surgery.  Beta-blocker therapy was discontinued in favor of a calcium-channel blocker given his significant obstructive pulmonary disease and response to bronchodilators.  Digoxin was discontinued given his preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and the absence of heart failure.  Diuretics were modified and the angiotensin receptor blocker dose reduced.
