#1 Metastatic colorectal cancer right lobe of liver
Favor right hepatectomy.  Goals, risks, complications and alternatives inclusive of staging laparoscopy to exclude diffuse peritoneal disease discussed with patient.  Patient consents to proceed.  Team Aspects of medical care discussed.
Reports:
10-Mar-2010 EXAM: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, including 3D imaging requiring an independent workstation. Comparison: 12/31/2009. CONCLUSION/IMPRESSION: Variable response in liver metastases. FINDINGS: Several liver metastases are again identified. There are a couple of lesions that appear slightly larger. For example a lesion on series 2 image #15 measures 34 x 27-mm in comparison to 31 x 25-mm previously. Also on the prior study it appeared more low-density than on today's study. A small lesion seen in the right lobe on image 24 also is slightly larger. The lesion on image #32 appears slightly smaller as does a lesion on image 37. The lesion in the dome on image 11 is not significantly changed. Otherwise no significant change. Stable cluster of nodularity in the left lower lobe. Postoperative changes of a low-anterior resection and omentectomy. Stable soft-tissue nodularity anterior to the descending colon on image 74 and nodularity of the left vaginal fornix. Hysterectomy. Diverticulosis. Tiny right kidney cyst. RT999 3D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and hepatic volumetry was performed. The total hepatic volume is 1912 cc. The volume of the right hepatic lobe, with a cut line just to the left of the middle hepatic vein and to the left of metastases at the junction of the right and left lobe is 1383 cc. The estimated residual hepatic volume (left lobe plus caudate) would be 529 cc, or approximately 28% of the total hepatic volume.
01Apr2010 06:07 ECG: VENTRICULAR RATE 64. Normal sinus rhythm with 1st degree A-V block. Nonspecific T-wave abnormality. When compared with ECG of 15-JUL-2009 23:17, No significant change was found.

From Dr Dilley's note dated 3-15-2010:
1.  July 15, 2009 - presented at GMHC Emergency Room with bilateral lower quadrant abdominal pain.  She was noted to have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.3.  CT-scan showed an 11- x 18- x 17-cm mass which appeared ovarian in origin and invaded into the uterus, the left superior pelvic side wall, and around the rectum.  There were multiple bilobar liver metastases and multiple implants in the abdomen.
2.  July 17, 2009 - colonoscopy showed a large friable lesion at 40 cm.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  July 20, 2009 - taken by Dr. Mello for a total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, anterior resection of the sigmoid, and total omentectomy.   Surgical pathology from the right ovary showed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma while the anterior sigmoid mass demonstrated grade 3 adenocarcinoma forming a 9- x 4.5- x 4-cm annular mass invading through all layers of the bowel wall to involve both the pericolonic fat and the visceral peritoneum.  There were negative surgical margins, and 1 (of 16) regional lymph nodes was positive.  The bladder peritoneum was involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma and omentectomy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma forming two masses.
4.  August 25, 2009, through December 2, 2009 - Eight cycles of FOLFOX plus Avastin therapy.  The dose of 5-FU had to be decreased 10% starting with cycle number two due to diarrhea.  This therapy led to good response with a CEA that was 109 preoperatively, dropping to 7.2 following cycle number eight.  Serial CT scans during therapy also showed continuing decrease in hepatic and peritoneal disease burden.
5.  December 2009 through present, Ms. Loveland has been on a chemotherapy holiday per her request.  She did not have any significant toxicities from oxaliplatin but did complain of increasing fatigue and did experience some mild cytopenias, odynophagia and mild toe numbness.  A CT-scan in late December revealed continued response to her therapy, and her CEA nadired at 7.2.  She was seen in February 2010 and her CEA had risen from 7.2 to 21.  She chooses to proceed with continued observation.

The patient lives with her husband in Bristol Michigan, Margarettsville.  She has 7 children and 29 grandchildren.  She states that her husband has, earlier in their relationship, been quite abusive to her and thus he is not really a resource for her.  She denies tobacco or alcohol use and is current back to work full-time as an insurance agent.
