Final Diagnosis
B.  Portion of sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Invasive poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin pools, consistent with prior treatment effect (moderate response, grade 1 of 3), forming a 5.0 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm ulcerated mass, located 1.7 cm from the distal resection resection margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria to extensively involve the pericolic fat, extending to 0.2 cm from the radial margin.  No definite angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The surgical margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin pools is identified in 16 (of 20) regional lymph nodes, with extranodal extension. 

A.  Soft tissue, right pelvic sidewall, biopsy:  Metastatic poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin pools, consistent with prior treatment effect, involving a lymph node. 

C.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Anastomotic ring with multiple sutures, identified grossly.

With available surgical material, [AJCC ypT3N2b] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right pelvic sidewall"" is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm fragment of tan tissue. All submitted.  Grossed by GUIDRY.

B.  Received fresh labeled portion sigmoid and rectum is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 25.0 cm in length portion of rectal colon.  A 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 1.7 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 0.2 cm from the radial margin.  Subjacent and concurrent with the mucosal ulcer is a 5.0 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm mucinous mass. Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat with multiple (15) grossly positive up to 4.8 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by COLE.

C.  Received fresh labeled distal anastomotic ring, rectum is a 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm portion of grossly unremarkable mucosal anastomotic ring with multiple sutures.  Grossed by COLE.
