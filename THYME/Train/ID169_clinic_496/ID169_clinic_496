Labs drawn 5/24/2010:
Hemoglobin 15.5  WBC 6.2  PLT 252  Sodium 145  Potassium 4.3  Calcium 9.2  Glucose 93  Alk-phos 71  AST 34  T. bilirubin 0.4  Creatinine 1.1  CEA 2.3
A2 13:29: VENTRICULAR RATE 56. Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise normal ECG. No previous ECGs available.
24-May-2010 15:12:00  Exam: CT CHEST w ABDOMEN w & PELVIS w
Chest: Small cyst or bleb in the posterior right upper lobe. Calcified granuloma left lower lobe. Lungs otherwise clear. Moderate-size esophageal hiatal hernia. Tiny cyst or nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications. No enlarged nodes.
Abdomen and pelvis: There is a 2-3-cm enhancing mass in the rectum, likely reflecting known carcinoma. Focal apparent narrowing in a very short-segment of the sigmoid colon is nonspecific ( it may reflect peristalsis) and should be better evaluated with endoscopy (series 2, image 105 ). Multiple low-attenuation lesions in the liver look like cysts; the largest is in the left lobe and measures 4.5-cm. Their cystic nature could be confirmed with ultrasound. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, some of which are parapelvic in location. The spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas enhance normally. Normal caliber abdominal aorta. No enlarged nodes. No ascites. Postoperative changes left inguinal hernia repair. Calcified pelvic phleboliths. A few sigmoid diverticula. Mild degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine.

69-yr-old male who underwent colonoscopy on 4/21/2010 to evaluate rectal bleeding. A-1-cm x 2-cm lesion was seen in the rectum and pathology revealed invasive
grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  He has had no change in bowel habits other than the bleeding.  CT chest/and/pelvis demonstrate 2-3-cm enhancing mass in the rectum, likely reflecting known carcinoma. Focal apparent narrowing in a very short-segment of the sigmoid colon is nonspecific. Multiple low-attenuation lesions in the liver look like cysts Multiple bilateral renal cysts, some of which are parapelvic in location. CEA from 5/24/10 is 2.3. EUS on 5/27/10 demonstrated rectal lesions consistent with likely T2 disease no adenopathy seen. He comes to the hospital at this time for surgical management.
