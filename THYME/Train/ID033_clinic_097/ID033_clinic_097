#1 Recently-diagnosed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the middescending colon
Mrs. Walters has essentially come to Colonel Florence A Blanchfield Army Hospital for surgical management of this.  In light of her CT-scan from the 17th of June 2010 demonstrating an ill-defined low-density area seen centrally in the liver, we are arranging an MRI of the liver to evaluate for any possible metastatic spread.  We will schedule Mrs. Walters to be seen by a colorectal surgeon for further management of this.  Her main concern is that she does not wish to have a colostomy, which she had back in the 1970s, and this will be discussed further with the surgeons.  Her pathology slides from the outside hospital have been given to Colonel Florence A Blanchfield Army Hospital this morning.
#2 Preoperative assessment and medical clearance
Mrs. Walters had an ECG performed on the 15th of June 2010 that demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormality seen.  The chest x-ray from the 15th of June 2010 demonstrated underinflated lungs with slight scarring or atelectasis in the bases with the chest appearance otherwise negative.  Her lab results frmo the 16th of June 2010 demonstrated a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 with a low platelet count of 67,000.  Her electrolytes were within normal limits.  Her renal function was normal and she is ok for surgery from a medical standpoint, but her platelet count should be monitored carefully. In regards to her diabetes, this is poorly-controlled with an HbA1c of 11.6 on the 16th of June 2010.  After discussion with Dr. Mendiola, it was felt that once she is admitted to the hospital, then the diabetes consulting service should follow her for more management of her diabetes perioperatively.

Mrs. Walters is a very pleasant 53-year-old lady from Ithaca, who comes to the clinic today accompanied by her husband.  She was seen in the gastroenterology clinic on the 17th of June 2010, by Dr. Jones and Dr. Betts, and below is the note from Dr. Echols consultation which I am inserting to provide details of her complex medical history.
Mrs. Walters experienced an extremely severe bout of pancreatitis in 1977.  This was complicated by two abscesses requiring surgical drainage as well as a pseudocyst necessitating internal drainage of some sort.  While her surgical drains were being changed, she experienced a colonic perforation requiring a resection and temporary diverting colostomy.  Eventually, her continuity was restored, but from this point on she experienced two-to-three bowel movements per day as her baseline bowel pattern.  In 1987, she had vomiting and right upper quadrant pain and underwent cholecystectomy.  She was diagnosed with diabetes in 2000, although was told by doctors taking care of her in 1977 that she would, no doubt, develop diabetes one-day.  Her blood glucose values were relatively well-controlled until October of 2008 in which time she was taken off her insulin pump due to insurant issues.  From that time period on, her control has been extremely poor.  In late 2009, she did experience intermittent postprandial abdominal pain symptoms.  In January of 2009, she was driving from El Paso back to California when she experienced the acute onset of lower abdominal severe pain.  This was approximately four to five hours after eating her last meal.  She had quite a bit of nausea and vomiting associated with this and was taken directly to the hospital in California.  She was hospitalized for one-week at which time a gastric emptying study was performed, and she was diagnosed with gastroparesis.  We have had this emptying study read here by our radiologist, and 22.6% of the contents were emptied at 60 minutes.  According to our read, this would be technically a normal study.  She also tells me that while she was undergoing this test, she was on quite a bit of Dilaudid for abdominal pain.  She was also taking Reglan, on which she was dismissed from the hospital.  While on Reglan, her pain, nausea, as well as vomiting significantly improved; however, she experienced severe psychosis, and this medication was discontinued in favor or erythromycin in March of 2009.  This also worked very well.  She began to eat very small frequent meals with improvement in her symptoms.  She was told in January of 2010 to go off of erythromycin due to risk of tachyphylaxis.  Several days after this, she began to exhibit her current symptomatology which consists of postprandial pain, gas, as well as bloating.  She tells me that approximately 30-minutes after any meal, she will experience severe lower abdominal pain which she describes as ten out of ten in severity and similar to having a baby.  This is accompanied by debilitating bloating and gas and occurs after almost every meal.  It has been worsening in severity over the last few months.  She denies any nausea or vomiting with these episodes.  The pain will persist until she eventually has a bowel movement at which time the pain will get better.
She does have a history of bleeding ulcers, which she relates to her episode of pancreatitis in 1977.  She has never had Helicobacter pylori.  She does have intermittent acid reflux for which she takes Pepcid with good relief.  She takes quite a bit of ibuprofen for migraines, approximately 800 mg two times per week.  She has never been tried on a lactose-free diet or pancreatic enzymes.   She has no personal or family history of gastric cancer, colon cancer, or celiac disease.
Labs prior to this visit are significant for a microcytic anemia down to 11.6 which is reasonably stable from December of 1997.  Her kidney function is adequate.  Her thyroid function is normal.  Her diabetic control is extremely suboptimal with an A1c of 11.6.  She does currently have a urinary tract infection and is being antibiotics for this.
On the 17th of June, 2010, Mrs. Walters underwent a CT enterography at Colonel Florence A Blanchfield Army Hospital which demonstrated a focal area of wall thickening in surrounding lymph nodes in the middescending colon which was representative of diverticulitis or colon cancer.  The results of this scan were discussed on the phone between Dr. Betts and Mrs. Walters on June 22, 2010, and it was recommended that she would need a colonoscopy.  On the 5th of July 2010, Mrs. Walters attended her local emergency room with recurrence of abdominal pain, and the CT-scan was repeated there which again demonstrated a mass in the middescending colon.  She then underwent a colonoscopy on the 16th of July 2010 in 64502 which demonstrated a 7-cm partially obstructing mass at 50 cm.  A biopsy of this was taken, and results from her local pathologist demonstrated invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  An EGD was also performed with duodenal biopsies taken that returned as normal bowel small with intact villous architecture.  Mrs. Walters informs me that she did bring the pathology slides with her to Hooper Bay Alaska, and these were entered into the system this morning.
From a symptom standpoint, Mrs. Walters is doing reasonably well with no issues of acute pain.  She does feel nauseous and occasional vomiting after eating, but has continued to pass gas on a daily basis and has not developed any signs or symptoms of bowel obstruction.
Her significant comorbidities are poorly-controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus, which she is currently on insulin for, but her sugars do rise up to the 300 range.  She has no known cardiac or pulmonary disorders.  She does have a background of ITP that has been stable.
