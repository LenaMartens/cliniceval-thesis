We had a long discussion with her and her daughter and mother with the help of an interpreter.  I have outlined to her that her best option for improving her disease-free survival would be surgical resection of the tumor mass.  Thus, she really would need a clear margin to produce good results.  We need to be sure that there is no disease elsewhere in the abdomen, in particular, if there is any evidence of carcinomatosis.  Tomorrow she will have a PET scan to further assess this.  If this turns out to be negative, then I think we should proceed with an exploratory laparotomy next week to assess if it is possible to resect this tumor mass.  Interestingly, on our CT-scan it looks like it is involving the uterus and ovaries, and I think she would require radical en bloc resection to remove pelvic organs and some small-bowel with her sigmoid colon.  She seems to have distal rectum which is uninvolved, and it may be possible to take-down the colostomy and restore intestinal continuity.  Another issue is she has had a recent DVT in femoral vein and is on Coumadin.  From this point of view, if we are going to perform surgery, we can stop her Coumadin, and I think it would be safe to treat her with Subcu heparin at the time of surgery, although we will get Coagulation to see her regarding this.  We are going to see her again on Friday afternoon with the results of her PET scan for further discussion.  We spent 30-minutes discussing all this today, and she seemed very happy with the information and is keen to proceed with surgery if this is what we recommend.

This lady has a complicated story dating from Sanford.  She had a colonoscopy performed showing a tumor in the sigmoid colon and subsequently underwent laparotomy with an intention to resect two days later.  After surgery, she was found to have a really bulky tumor that had formed a mass involving multiple loops of small-bowel.  The surgeons in Niwot felt it was inoperable and performed a colostomy to divert her and started her on chemotherapy.  Since that, she has received three-months of Erbitux.  She has done reasonably well, although complains of fatigue.  She has had some trouble with diarrhea, and it would appear from her recent imaging that she has formed a fistula between proximal small-bowel and her distal colon.  She has come to SCNH to see if surgical resection is a possibility.  We have repeated her imaging and brought a CT-scan and compared with the film from January, and it would appear the tumor has shrunk somewhat.
