#1 Stage IIA colon cancer
We discussed with Dr. Fenwick the controversy surrounding adjuvant therapy for stage II colon cancer.  He does not have any of the high-risk features for stage II disease such as a T4 lesion, fewer than 13 lymph nodes removed, poorly-differentiated cancer with signet cell or mucinous features.  In addition, the microsatellite instability present is known to carry a better prognosis and to predict for lack of adjuvant therapy benefit.
Based on the available evidence, our recommendations would be to not proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy.  We discussed there is a good chance for cure, and we are not certain whether adjuvant chemotherapy would again increase the chance of survival in this situation.
We discussed that giving him the microsatellite instability, genetic consultation would be recommended to discuss testing for these abnormalities looking for somatic mutations of the DNA gene repair mechanism. Dr. Fenwick is going to Slagle shortly and would follow-up with physician recommendations there.
We discussed follow-up for this type of colon cancer which would involve history, physical examination, and imaging studies every three or six-month basis.
Dr. Fenwick was appreciative of the information.  I discussed with him that he should feel to call with questions or concerns in the future.  He may be coming back in three-months, and he will let us know if he is interested in following-up here at that time, although he will make an appointment and develop a relationship with a medical oncologist in Slagle where he lives.  We will be happy to forward any imaging studies or records there at his request.

Dr. Fenwick is a 50-year-old gentleman, who developed anemia.  Colonoscopy found a mass in the ascending colon, and it was biopsy-proven to be adenocarcinoma.  The patient had staging workup with CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis which was negative, other than the suggestion of a mass in the ascending colon.  He underwent surgery on the 22nd of June.  An 8.5-cm mass was found, grade 3 out of 4 adenocarcinoma, with tumor invading through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat, negative margins, and all 38 lymph nodes negative for cancer (T3, N0).
Microsatellite instability testing was performed.  By immunohistochemistry, there was loss of MLH-1 and PMS-2 and retention of MSH-2 and MSH-6.  By BCR assay, there was instability in 5 out of 5 informative markers (MSI-H).
Dr. Fenwick is here with his father who is a waqhqog lgzthxzgnmd at the Spencer Municipal Medical Center to discuss adjuvant options.
