Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, left lateral pelvic margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor. Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Karlene I. Mckinney, M.D.

B.  Rectum, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Multiple scattered microscopic foci of residual viable tumor within a 3.6 x 3.4 x 0.3 cm ulcerated rectal mass.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The tumor extends to within 0.7 cm of the radial resection margin.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (21) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""left lateral pelvic margin"" is a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm portion of tan-yellow fibrous tissue without orientation.  Margin/all submitted. 

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 32.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 4.0 cm in length portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked.  A 3.6 x 3.4 x 0.3 cm ulcerative mass is present on the anterior wall of rectum, 3.6 cm from the dentate line, 7.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 0.7 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by TALKINGTON.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Lisa Williams, PCR-based testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) will be performed on rectal cancer tissue sections (block B3); when completed, results will be available in TRSO VhjbEetm.
