I had a long discussion with the patient.  I also discussed his case in detail with Dr. Terry Henderson in Colon and Rectal Surgery.  I think this patient is better served being seen in the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery and they have graciously agreed to see him this afternoon.  I am optimistic with his minimal obstructive symptoms that this patient may in fact be a candidate for a prep and resection with primary anastomosis.
We did discuss the potential options of primary anastomosis versus stoma.  I also made it clear to the patient that he would need to be seen by Medical Oncology postoperatively for chemotherapy.  The patient understands and is eager to see Colon and Rectal Surgery this afternoon.  He is all schedule this morning for chest x-ray and preoperative evaluation.

Mr. Damron is a healthy 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department last week with left lower quadrant pain.  Imaging and subsequent work-up revealed a perforated sigmoid colon cancer.  The patient was doing well at the time and elected to go home for several days to get his affairs in order.  Unfortunately, his wife is also currently at the clinic undergoing evaluation for malignancy.
The patient comes in today for a follow-up and plan of care.  He is feeling well.  He has no obstructive symptoms and he is not taking any pain medication.
