Mr. Schwartz was noted on February 12 to have complaints of dizziness and weakness.  A hemoglobin was checked at that time and noted to be 8.7 from a previous value of 14 in December 2009.  Repeat hemoglobin was further down to 7.9.  He was transfused. In light of his anemia it was recommended that he undergo further evaluation and he had a colonoscopy on February 17.  This was revealing for a 3-cm friable malignant-appearing mucosal mass at the hepatic flexure.  The area was biopsied and pathology returned this a.m. and was revealing for invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  A CT-scan was negative for metastatic disease. He comes now for surgical management of this colon cancer.
