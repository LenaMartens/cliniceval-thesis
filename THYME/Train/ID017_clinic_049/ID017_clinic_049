Mrs. Stackhouse is a very pleasant 78-year-old female with history of sigmoid colon cancer in the past with T3, N1 resected mass that developed liver metastases.  These were resected with Dr. Jesse Wiseman.  She has been doing fine up until recently when a routine colonoscopy showed a mass in the right colon which unfortunately was adenocarcinoma.  She also has a smaller polyp in the proximal transverse colon, another polyp in the left-side, i.e., 25 cm from the anal verge.  The left-sided polyp was removed and pathology was a tubular adenoma with moderate dysplasia.  She presents now for further surgical intervention.
Her PMH and PSH is outlined below.
