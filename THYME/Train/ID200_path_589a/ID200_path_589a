Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, biopsy:  Necrotizing granuloma; negative for tumor.

B.  Sigmoid colon and adherent portion of small bowel, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, polypoid, circumferential mass (10.0 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm) involving the sigmoid colon, situated 8.0 cm from the proximal resection margin.  The tumor perforates through the muscularis propria to involve the pericolic fat, associated with marked acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation and fibrosis.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The inflammatory process extends to the serosal surface, into the portion of adherent abdominal wall and focally through the wall of the adherent portion of small bowel.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (28) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""liver biopsy"" is a 2.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm aggregate of red brown tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by HAWKINS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a 38.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon adherent to a 15.0 cm segment of small bowel and omentum.  There is a 10.6 x 7.8 x 6.0 cm ulcerated polypoid circumferential mass located 8.0 cm from the nearest proximal mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass invades through the muscularis propria and extends into the pericolonic fat and is associated with an organizing abscess which adheses the colon to the small bowel, the peritoneum, and the anterior abdominal wall.  The small intestine mucosa appears dusky but uninvolved by tumor.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by HAWKINS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""distal margin, rectum"" is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm portion of donut shaped tan-red tissue without orientation.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by HAWKINS.



Addendum Diagnosis
Special stains (Grocott's methenamine silver and acid fast bacilli) are negative for microorganisms.
