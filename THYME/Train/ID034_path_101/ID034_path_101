Final Diagnosis
A.  Right colon, portion omentum, hemicolectomy:  Undifferentiated grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.6 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm ulcerated mass in the right colon.   Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (8 of 15) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in SNNF EqslTnoo.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
