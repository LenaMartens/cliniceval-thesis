Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Rare keratin positive cell present within the submucosa, underlying an area of mucosal ulceration, situated 3.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin (s/p neoadjuvant therapy).  There is prominent submucosal and subserosal fibrosis with acellular mucin pools within the muscularis propria, indicative of moderate tumor regression.  A separate biopsy site is identified within the sigmoid colon, 12.0 cm from the rectal lesion and 22.5 cm from the proximal margin.  No residual adenocarcinoma seen within the sigmoid colon.  Diverticulosis present.  Multiple (27) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor (verified by keratin immunostain).

B.  Rectosigmoid, proximal ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa.  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa.  Gross examination only.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled sigmoid and rectum is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 38.5 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon without anus.  There is an area of induration with overlying mucosal ulceration, 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm present within the rectum, 3.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 1.2 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent. There is also a 0.9 x 0.9 cm site in the sigmoid colon, 22.5 cm from the proximal margin and 12.0 cm from the rectal ulcer.  Diverticulosis is also present (16 diverticula).  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SANCHEZ.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal rectal ring"" is a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm portion of colon without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by SANCHEZ.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal ring"" is a 2.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 cm portion of colon without orientation.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by SANCHEZ.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Biopsy site changes present within the sigmoid.  The rectum demonstrates acellular mucinous pools, but no viable tumor cells seen.  Defer to permanent sections.
