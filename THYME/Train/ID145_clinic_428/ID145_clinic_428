#1 Resected metastatic colon adenocarcinoma (T3, N0, M1 [liver])
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Drs. Delaney and Ricketts service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Collins, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
We have recommended additional systemic chemotherapy.  Mrs. Martinez does plan on receiving additional treatment closer to home, but we would recommend that she return in the outpatient setting for evaluation.  She wishes to return.  Therefore, I have made follow-up arrangements for the patient to return in approximately four weeks.  At that time, she will undergo a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, comprehensive lab panel including a CEA, and an appointment with Dr. Jamie Sanchez in Medical Oncology as well as a postoperative evaluation with Drs. Andrews and Zhang.  She will also make contact with Dr. Parker, her local medical oncologist, and ensure that an appointment follows ours to make sure there is continuity of care and she is initiated on additional chemotherapy in a timely fashion.  She verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.

Mrs. Martinez is a very pleasant 38-year-old female from 91392, Kentucky.
1.  December 2009 - developed intermittent abdominal cramping, change in bowel habits, and one episode of blood red blood.  She also had a progressive 25-pound weight-loss (part of this intentional).
2.  March 22, 2010 - underwent colonoscopy which identified a strictured area at 20 cm.  Biopsies were obtained and confirmed adenocarcinoma.  HNPCC testing was negative with no evidence of DNA mismatch repair.
3.  March 25, 2010 - underwent CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis which identified a sigmoid mass as well as regional lymphadenopathy extending into the lower rectum at the level of the aortic bifurcation.  There were small indeterminate hepatic lesions.
4.  March 30, 2010 - referred to Blakely House Health Care Center and underwent CT enterography which identified the sigmoid mass.  There were malignant-appearing lymph nodes posterolateral to the mass associated with inferior mesenteric artery.  PET scan showed increased FDG uptake in the liver, as well as uptake in the lymph nodes at the aortic bifurcation.  She was evaluated by Drs. Andrews, Zhang, Bobby Franklin, and Jesse Turner.  The joint consensus was to have the patient return home and receive chemotherapy in the form of FOLFOX and return for surgical intervention.
5.  April 2010 to May 2010 - underwent FOLFOX chemotherapy locally.  Overall tolerated well.  Avastin was not given.  K-ras mutant BRAF wild type.
6.  June 15, 2010 - referred to Blakely House Health Care Center.  CT-scan and MRI imaging showed shrinkage in the known sigmoid tumor as well as the liver lesions and aortic bifurcation lymphadenopathy.
7.  June 18, 2010 - taken for a joint resection by Drs. Andrews and Zhang.  Per the operative note, surgical resection R0 with IORT not given even though there was a-1-mm margin on the left iliac artery and vein.  The risk of IORT outweighed the benefit.  Pathology: invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 4.9-cm x 3.5-cm x 3.1-cm annular mass in the rectum.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  There were multiple soft-tissue deposits of adenocarcinoma within the pericolonic fat near the regional lymph nodes present, and 19 regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  The tumor was noted to extend to within 0.1 cm of the radial resection margins.  Liver Segment VII resection showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, liver Segment VII No. 2 showed metastatic colon adenocarcinoma forming a 0.6-cm x 0.6-cm x 0.5-cm mass.  Liver Segment V resection showed metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, and liver Segments IVb and V showed metastatic colon adenocarcinoma forming a 0.2-cm x 0.2-cm x 0.2-cm mass.  There were negative surgical margins on all liver resections.
Mrs. Martinez is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in a chair during our consultation today.
