#1 Large sigmoid polyp, not amenable to endoscopic resection
The plan is to proceed with hand-assisted low-anterior resection tomorrow at Harriman City General Hospital.  I discussed with the patient and her family the nature of the operation and indications.  The plan is to resect this area with the lymph nodes to ensure we do not have a malignancy.  I discussed with her the risks of an anastomotic leak which may require emergency surgery, possible temporary stoma, possible antibiotic use, or drainage use.  I explained to her that risk is somewhere between 1% and 2%.  Other risks discussed with her included urinary tract infections, wound infections, and pneumonia.  The potential need for blood transfusion, although rare, was discussed with her, and she is willing to accept a blood transfusion if needed.  Other risks discussed included blood clots, heart attack, and acute cardiopulmonary events, and the patient wishes to be resuscitated in case of an event.  I explained to the patient that we may not be able to do this with a minimally-invasive approach because of her prior surgery, and she may need a larger incision.  After all this discussion, the patient agreed to proceed with surgery.  She was marked.  Consent form was signed.

Discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure and of possible blood transfusion.  Discussed advance directives and the necessity of other members of the healthcare team participating in the procedure.  All questions answered and consent given.

Initially she was told it was upper rectal.  Underwent a colonoscopy today by Dr. Bradley Hendricks that clearly shows that it is in the sigmoid.  He tattooed the area below it.  Her past history is notable for having abdominal exploration for an ovarian cyst in her 20s but since then has had no other problems.  Family history is noted as a history of breast cancer but no colon cancer.
