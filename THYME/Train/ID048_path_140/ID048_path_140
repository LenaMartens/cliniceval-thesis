Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Microscopic foci of residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, with treatment effect, are identified over a 4.3 x 4.1 x 1.2 cm fibrotic area located in the distal rectum, situated 3.0 cm from the dentate line.  Tumor invades just through the muscularis propria into perirectal fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  Perineural invasion is present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (5 of 15) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma with treatment effect.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.
