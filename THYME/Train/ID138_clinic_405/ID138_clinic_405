#1 Hepatic flexure cancer
Colonoscopy showed residual hepatic flexure neoplasm. This was biopsied extensively and then photocoagulated and tattooed. Pathology showed this to be invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with residual adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Mr. King's outside pathology from 23 December 2009 showed hepatic flexure polyp tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and areas suspicious for invasion. EGD showed grade B ulcerative esophagitis and gastric biopsies showed active chronic gastritis and numerous Helicobacter pylori and no intestinal metaplasia. Esophagus showed mild hyperplastic squamous esophageal mucosa with no intraepithelial eosinophils identified. Mr. King should probably be treated for Helicobacter again, but we will wait to a later date or possibly this could be done at-home. His most pressing issue is his hepatic flexure cancer. I have ordered CT abdomen and pelvis. Patient saw Dr. Drew Ledbetter of Colon and Rectal Surgery. Patient is scheduled for surgery 25 March 2010. I will see the patient back with Dr. Ledbetter and CT results on 24 March 2010. Again patient is okay anesthesia with no cardiopulmonary issues.
