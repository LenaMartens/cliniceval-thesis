#1 Resected stage III sigmoid adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Irwin service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Gaston, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
Mrs. Tai has decided to return in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation.  Therefore, I have made follow-up arrangements for the patient to return in approximately four weeks.  At that time, she will undergo a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive lab panel including a CEA, and an appointment with us in Medical Oncology.  I did urge her to make contact with a local medical oncologist in the Burns area to help ensure continuity of care, which she plans on doing.  She verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.

I was asked by Dr. Roy's service to visit with Mrs. Tai for postoperative education purposes.
Briefly, Mrs. Tai is a very pleasant 33-year-old female from Toston, Santa Barbara.  She has a past medical history significant for a hepatoblastoma diagnosed and treated when she was 9 months old with a right liver lobectomy and eight to nine months of adriamycin plus an additional chemotherapy drug (the details are unclear).  She also has a possible FAP.
1.  January 2010 - presented with persistent diarrhea.  She was noted to have positive C. difficile and was treated with antibiotics.  The diarrhea did not improve, and she also had occasional blood with bowel movements.
2.  March 25, 2010 - flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed identifying multiple polyps as well as a large sigmoid polyp.  This was biopsied and confirmed to be adenocarcinoma involving the muscularis mucosa, but the depth of the invasion was not able to be ascertained.
3.  April 1, 2010 - referred to VMH and underwent colonoscopy.  This identified at least 50 to 60 polyps consistent with attenuated variant FAP, as well as a sigmoid mass.  Biopsies from the left-side of the colon showed active colitis.  CT enterography was negative for distant metastasis, but did identify a Meckel's diverticulum, medullary calcifications suggesting a sponge kidney, and a probable endochondroma of the right femoral head.
4.  April 2, 2010 - evaluated by Medical Genetics.  She deferred further medical genetics testing until a later date.
5.  April 6, 2010 - taken by Dr. Kerry Roy for a laparoscopic proctocolectomy, double-stapled J-pouch, ileoanal anastomosis, and diverting ileostomy.  Per the operative note, multiple polyps were identified.  Surgical pathology noted grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.1-cm x 2.8-cm x 0.8-cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon invading into the muscularis propria.  There were negative surgical margins.  There were greater than 150 tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia also identified, and 1 of 61 regional lymph nodes was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  This was staged at a T2, N1, M0 resected colon adenocarcinoma.
Mrs. Tai is continuing to recover from surgery and was up ambulating during our consultation today.
