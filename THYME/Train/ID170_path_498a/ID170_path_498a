Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph nodes, apical, lymphadenectomy:  A single apical lymph node is negative for tumor.

B.  Transverse colon, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.1 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic vascular invasion is present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (30) lymph nodes are negative for tumor. 

C.  Colon, right polyp, biopsy:  Tubular adenoma, low grade dysplasia (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm).

D.  Liver, portion of segment II and III, resection:  Focal nodular hyperplasia forming a 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm mass.  Margins are widely free.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Pat C. Sena, M.D.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""apical lymph nodes"" is a 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by JENNINGS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""transverse colon; tattoo-distal, stitch-proximal"" is an oriented transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 19.0 cm of colon and 27.0 x 16.2 x 1.2 cm portion of omentum.  A 3.1 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm ulcerative mass is present within the transverse colon, 5.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin and 2.5 cm from the mesenteric margin.  There is tattoo ink on the serosal surface.  The deepest extent of the tumor is 0.7 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by JENNINGS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon polyp"" is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm tan red portion of tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by LARUE.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""liver, portion of segment II and III"" is a 63.1 gram, 10.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm mass is present 2.0 cm from the inked surgical margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LARUE.


Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Ms. Kim Grant, CNP, PCR-based testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) will be performed on transverse colon adenocarcinoma tissue sections (block B2); when completed, results will be available in FWWQ CesyZhps.


Addendum Diagnosis
The non-involved liver parenchyma (part D) shows patchy mild portal lymphocytic infiltrate with no significant interface activity.  The interlobular bile ducts appear intact.  The hepatic acinar parenchyma shows normal trabecular arrangement with no significant steatosis or necroinflammatory activity.  The trichrome stain shows patchy portal fibrosis.  The iron stain is negative and the PAS-d stain shows no intracytoplasmic hyaline globules.  


Internal Comments
5/26/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for MSI only at request of Kim Grant, CNP/dixon
