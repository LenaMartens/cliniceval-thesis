Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, uterus, bilateral tubes, and ovaries; en bloc resection:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm polypoid mass.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. Multiple (3 of 12) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  [AJCC pT3N1MX].  The uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved by tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
