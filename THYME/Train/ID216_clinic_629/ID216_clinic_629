I reviewed outside records including her CT images.
#1 Colon adenocarcinoma
Risk factors for developing colon cancer include her age, obesity, and history of tobacco use.  This has been histologically confirmed elsewhere, and she brought her pathology slides, which are being reviewed here as well.  We have reviewed her CT-scan that on our read does not demonstrate any clear evidence of distal disease.  However, there does appear to be at least one lesion in the spleen and the overall image quality of this study is poor.  As a result we suggested that she repeat a CT-scan with abdomen and pelvis here to complete the staging process.  She will also have a chest x-ray.  She is scheduled to meet with Dr. Gilmore on September 16.
#2 Aortic stenosis, severe on outside echocardiogram
#3 History of coronary artery bypass disease
Prior to her undergoing any form of surgical intervention, we will need to have preoperative clearance from one of our cardiology colleagues.  On the outside report, it seems like her gradient would classify this as severe aortic stenosis.  Will plan to obtain an echocardiogram here.  She does not endorse any clear symptoms; however, she is not physically exerting herself to a severe degree, so whether or not this is truly asymptomatic is not clear to me.
#4 Followup
Following her cardiology evaluation and their opinion regarding her fitness for surgery, will plan to see her back with our colorectal surgery colleagues to determine a definitive plan.
This patient was discussed and examined with Dr. Ryan.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at Goulds Hospital.

Mrs. Jones is a 77-year-old woman who presents to the GI Neoplasia Clinic for colon adenocarcinoma that was recently-diagnosed.  She had her annual general medical exam in April of 2010 at which point she was noted to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 10.6.  At that time she did not have any symptoms, and a colonoscopy was recommended.  This study, per report, only demonstrated diverticulosis.  She subsequently underwent a hematology evaluation which included ferritin levels that were normal and a bone marrow biopsy that was unrevealing and was recommended to have a six-month followup.  At the beginning of this month on September 1 she developed bright-red blood per rectum.  This lasted for a couple days, so she returned to her outpatient provider.  Due to this symptom she was admitted to the hospital.  Her hemoglobin remained unchanged at 10.5.  She underwent a repeat colonoscopy the following day on September 3.  This demonstrated a large colon mass in the distal transverse colon that was estimated to be 6 to 8-cm in size.  There were ulcerations, and the mucosa was noted to be friable.  This area was tattooed, and multiple biopsies were taken that demonstrated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration into the stroma.  A CT-scan of the abdomen done the following day demonstrated this mass but did not demonstrate any synchronous lesions or lymphadenopathy.  The radiologist did comment on gastric wall thickening, and on our review it appears that there is a lesion in the spleen.  Her bleeding symptoms stopped approximately three days later.  She continues to have minimal symptoms, denying any abdominal pain, change in appetite.  She has had an intentional 5-pound weight-loss over the last two-months.  Over the last three days, she has noticed that her stool caliber has been narrowed but prior to this was not having any difficulties with constipation or diarrhea.
She does have a significant cardiac history.  She underwent a four-vessel CABG in 1997.  Since that time, she denies any recurrent episodes of chest pain.  She has had aortic stenosis which has been known for some time.  During her recent hospitalization a repeat echocardiogram was done, and by the outside reports, the gradient was over 40 mm Hg.  She was seen by one of the local cardiologists who suggested a coronary catheterization preoperatively.  Due to the slow pace of scheduling this, she presented to Goulds Hospital for further evaluation.  Her functional status is limited in large part due to osteoarthritis.  She reports she is able to walk two-to-three blocks at a slow-to-moderate pace but does have a fair amount of shortness-of-breath with this.  She previously had been on aspirin but stopped taking this following the recent onset of her GI bleeding.
