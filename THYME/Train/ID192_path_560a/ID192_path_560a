Final Diagnosis
A.	Colon, ascending and portion of small bowel, abdominal colectomy:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, grade 3 (of 4), forming a 12.0 x 8.5 x 8.0 cm ulcerated and annular mass in the cecum.  Tumor invades the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The fat is adherent to abdominal wall as an inflammatory and fibrotic mass but viable tumor is not identified.  Lymphatic invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (21) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  There are multiple (>50) polyps (0.2 cm to 1.2 cm) throughout the colon.  Unremarkable appendix.

B.	Rectum, resection:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, grade 3 (of 4), forming a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass in the rectum.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (1 of 9) regional lymph node is positive for tumor.  Multiple (5) tubular adenomas (0.3 cm to 0.8 cm) are seen in the background.  

C.	Anus, resection:  Negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC  pT4(m) N1a] (7th edition, 2010). 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled abdominal colon and portion small bowel is a total abdominal colectomy specimen consisting of 46.0 cm in length portion of ileum, 96.0 cm in length colon, and a 9.0 x 1.2 cm appendix. A 12.0 x 8.5 x 8.0 cm ulcerative and annular mass is present within the cecum, abutting the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the abdominal wall nodule and adheres to a loop of terminal ileum serosa.  The lumen is strictured at the ileocecal valve to 0.8 cm in diameter. The mass is 44.0 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  There are  multiple (>50) mucosal polyps ranging from 0.2 cm to 1.6 cm, which are predominantly located in the ascending colon.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CONWAY.

B.	Received fresh labeled rectum is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 17.0 cm in length portion of rectum colon.  A 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 2.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin. Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle.  There are 5 additional polyps ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.8 cm.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CONWAY.

C.	Received fresh labeled ""anus"" is a 5.1 x 3.9 x 1.8 cm portion of distal rectum and anus.  No polyps identified grossly.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MANSOUR
