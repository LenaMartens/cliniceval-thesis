I saw Mrs. Roth in the past in conjunction with Dr. Bennie Cheeks as part of evaluation for a newly-diagnosed colon adenocarcinoma.  Ultimately, she went to surgery with Dr. Bobby Bales on June 8, 2010, and had a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy.  Surgical pathology noted a tumor invading through the muscularis propria with negative surgical margins and 24 regional lymph nodes negative for disease.  There was no evidence of distant disease.  She was staged at a T3, N0, M0.  I discussed the case with Dr. Cheeks, and at this point, we are not recommending any further treatment.  She has a high probability that her cancer has been cured with surgery alone, and given her advanced age and multiple co-morbid conditions, further treatment is not indicated.  That being the case, she does not need to follow with us in Medical Oncology, but I would recommend she followup with her local primary-care provider.  She understands she will need a colonoscopy in a year.  Certainly, if any problems or concerns arise, she is welcome to call.  I am not making routine followup appointments at this time as she will followup with her primary-care provider.  All questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Her daughter was also available at the time.
