I explained to the patient that he needs to have surgery.  I think he will need to have an abdominoperineal resection, but we will try and take the specimen out and see if we have a descent margin.  If the margins are closer or if we cannot get a margin, then he will need abdominoperineal resection.  He understands and is willing to accept a permanent colostomy.  Listed for surgery later in the month.

Seeing Mr. Wright direct.  He is a 41-year-old gentleman who was found to have a large rectal cancer that was obviously a T3 on the outside CT-scan.  It looks to be fairly aggressive with several enlarged lymph nodes in the perirectal region.  He has received preoperative chemoradiation and comes to TR for surgery.
