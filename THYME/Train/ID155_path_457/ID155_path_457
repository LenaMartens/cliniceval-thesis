Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, rectum, resection:  Invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm mass in the rectum arising within a tubular adenoma.  No therapy effect is identified status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (tumor viability, 100%).  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (10) regional lymph nodes are negative for adenocarcinoma.  With available surgical material [AJCC yT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
