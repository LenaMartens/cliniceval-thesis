#1  Adenocarcinoma of the colon status-post ascending laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with anastomosis March 29, 2010
#2  Pulmonary arterial hypotension
#3  Postoperative intubation and mechanical ventilation, extubated
#4  Leukocytosis, likely reactive
#5  Hyponatremia
#6  Hyperglycemia
#7  Mild creatinine elevation
#8  History of hypertension
#9  History of moderate coronary artery disease
#10  History of hyperlipidemia
PLAN BY SYSTEMS
1. Neurological.  Pain control to continue with a fentanyl PCA, eventual transition to enteral medications.
2. Pulmonary.  Clinically oxygenating and ventilating well.  Encourage good pulmonary toilet.  I would titrate her supplemental oxygen keeping her saturations between 85% and 90%.  She is currently on 4 L nasal cannula which is reportedly her baseline.  Continue sildenafil.
3. Cardiovascular.  Acceptable hemodynamics and a bit on the hypertensive side.  We will restart her anti-hypertensives which will include her amlodipine, clonidine, and metoprolol.  As mentioned before, we will continue her sildenafil.  If her pressures continue to be elevated, I would restart her ACE-inhibitor; and ongoing evaluation of her volume status would seem to indicate she is euvolemic.  I would probably restart her furosemide tomorrow morning.  Overall, she needs to be kept on the dry side of euvolemia.
4. Renal.  Adequate renal function.  Her renal indices appear to be stable.
5. Gastrointestinal.  Continue to advance diet as tolerated.  Continue omeprazole.
6. Infectious disease.  No issues.
7. Hematological.  No transfusion requirements.  TEDS, SCDs, and we will discuss with the surgical service about starting subcutaneous heparin.
8. Endocrine.  Glycemic control could be better.  Ongoing adjustment of her sliding-scale to continue.  Continue simvastatin.
9. Musculoskeletal.  It would be nice if she got out of bed.
10. Access.  She currently has peripheral access only.
11. Disposition.  I think she is reasonable to transfer to the floor.

Overnight, Ms. Sharer has had a good night.  Her sedation was turned off.  She was successfully extubated.  Her pain has been reasonably well-controlled.  She has had no respiratory issues.  Her hemodynamics have been stable.  She has made adequate amounts of urine.  Surgical service appears happy.
I have seen and evaluated the patient and reviewed the pertinent imaging and laboratory data.  I have discussed the patient's care with the Critical Care house staff as well as nursing.  Please refer to the resident's note of today's date for additional details.
