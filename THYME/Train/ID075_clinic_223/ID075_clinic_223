#1 Colon cancer
Two synchronous tumors have been surgically removed on January 26 by Dr. Wing.  The more distal is a stage III tumor while the more proximal is a stage II tumor.  All macroscopic disease was resected.  Mr. Vestal is currently without evidence of disease.  This is supported by a CT-scan performed earlier today of the abdomen that shows no evidence of tumor.  A CEA is 2.3.
I have discussed with Mr. Vestal and his wife the potential benefits and the risks of adjuvant chemotherapy.  I explained to him that the purpose of chemotherapy is to decrease the chance of recurrence.  Since Mr. Vestal is a very fit looking 83-year-old gentleman, I recommended that he start chemotherapy with FOLFOX.  I told him that often in patients his age an alternative approach is to give capecitabine only and that should he not tolerate the full FOLFOX regimen he could always change to 5-FU or capecitabine only.  We discussed the potential risks of the chemotherapy including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, immune suppression, diarrhea, mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, and cold intolerance.  Mr. Vestal stated that he understood this, and he is still eager to go ahead with the chemotherapy.  He, however, would like to have this done closer to his home in Queen.  I stated that  adjuvant chemotherapy should be started four to six-weeks after the surgical procedure.  I emphasized the need for follow-up after completion of the chemotherapy.  This should especially consist of physical examination and a repeat colonoscopy after one-year.  This should be done especially in the light of the multiple polyps found during Mr. Vestal's medical workup.
#2 Area of patchy fibrosis in the lung
This was seen on a chest x-ray.  Followup is recommended.
#3 Small gastrointestinal stromal tumor
I explained to Mr. Vestal that this was resected in its entirety and that no further follow-up is required.

Mr. Vestal's oncological history is as follows:
1.  January 20, 2010, presented to West District Center for work-up of dyspnea and iron-deficiency anemia.
2.  Colonoscopy on January 22, 2010, noted a mass in the transverse colon mass.  Pathology showed grade 3  adenocarcinoma.
3.  January 26, 2010, laparoscopic right hemicolectomy by Dr. Wing.  According to the operative report, the liver was palpated and there was felt to be no tumor.  The pathology report describes two invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinomas.  Tumor #1 was located in the ascending colon, 5.8 x 4.3 x 1.6-cm; 5.5 cm from the ileocecal valve invading into the pericolic fat.  For this area, 27 lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease.  Tumor #2 formed a 6.2- x 4.5- x 2.2-cm mass also invading into the pericolic fat.  Two out of twelve regional lymph nodes in this area were positive for metastatic disease.  Additionally, there were two hyperplastic polyps and a sessile serrated adenoma.  Of note, there was also a 0.3-cm gastrointestinal stromal tumor without mitotic activity.  The colon cancer was staged T3, N1, MX.
Mr. Vestal comes to Eastern Montana Hospital for a postoperative follow-up.  He states that his postoperative course has been benign and that he is now feeling much better than before the surgery.  His appetite is good.  He has gained some weight and is back at work.
