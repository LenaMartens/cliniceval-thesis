Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, cecum, ascending, transverse, resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4), adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm mass in the appendiceal orifice arising in a background of appendiceal diffuse serrated adenoma.  Adenocarcinoma invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (18) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  Biopsy site change is identified in the ascending colon.  The bowel serosa is densely fibrotic, predominantly in the ileum.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, colon: ascending and portion of transverse"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 24.0 cm of terminal ileum, 12.0 cm of colon, and a 2.2 x 0.5 cm appendix.  A 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm ulcerative mass is present within the cecum/appendiceal orifice, 2.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the mucosa.  The mass is 14.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  The ascending colon reveals a superficial biopsy site (1.0 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm) that is 9.5 cm to the distal mucosal margin and 6.0 cm to the ileocecal valve.  The terminal ileum demonstrates a foci (3.0 x 3.0 cm) of mucosal effacement 12.0 cm to the ileocecal valve and 15.0 cm to proximal mucosal margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by EASLEY.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, cecum, ascending, transverse, resection:  Moderately grade 3 (of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm mass in the appendiceal orifice arising in a background of appendiceal diffuse serrated adenoma.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (     ) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
