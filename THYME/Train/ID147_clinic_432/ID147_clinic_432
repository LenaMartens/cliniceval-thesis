#1 Rectal cancer
She has already had significant workup.  I will have her meet with Dr. Rodarte this afternoon to see if he wants to repeat an endoscopic ultrasound here or whether he is comfortable with the one done locally.  I discussed with her she will likely need an APR versus a coloanal procedure.  Discussed briefly about the coloanal procedure and the need for a diverting ileostomy if this is decided upon.  We will tentatively set-up a stoma nurse appointment.  At this point if it is truly a T2, likely we would proceed to surgery without neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.  I discussed briefly about Lynch syndrome/hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) as she has a brother with a brain tumor and mom with a questionable malignancy and a distant family history of colorectal cancer.  We will discuss with Dr. Rodarte whether IHC testing is appropriate or whether it would change the treatment plan.
#2 Indeterminate liver mass
Discussed with her that the PET did not highlight this area, so this is likely encouraging.  We will discuss with Dr. Rodarte whether he would like an ultrasound or other modality to repeat staging to re-evaluate prior to surgery.
#3 Hypertension
Well-controlled.
#4 Hyperlipidemia
Stable.
#5 Breast cancer
She has currently been completely treated for this at this point and will have follow-up with Oncology regarding in six-months.
#6 PAME
Will get EKG, chest x-ray, and basic blood work.  I will see her back with Dr. Rodarte this afternoon.
Seventy minutes spent with Mrs. Smith.  She was seen alone.  Multiple questions were answered.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at Nuuanu Associates Center.  We are having this scanned in.
CODE STATUS: Discussed with patient, she would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Smith is seen at the request of Dr. Aycock for evaluation of rectal cancer.

[start section id="20103"]

Mrs. Smith is a 62-year-old female from 18037, here for definitive treatment of her rectal cancer.  Dr. Aycock has requested she be seen by Dr. Charlie Rodarte.   She has had a recent series of unfortunate events.
In August 2009 she had an abnormal left-sided mammogram.  Later in August she underwent an ultrasound and then in October an ultrasound-guided biopsy which revealed ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS).  She underwent a lumpectomy on October 14, 2009, and then left mastectomy on November 4, 2009.  In reviewing the outside reports, pathology revealed a T1, N0 (immunohistochemistry positive) infiltrating ductal cancer with a 4-mm tumor.  In reviewing her outside reports, this was HER2 negative, PR-negative, and ER negative.  I do not have the official operative report or pathology report from her mastectomy.  It was decided that she needed to be treated with radiation therapy, and she underwent radiation treatment starting on January 8 and ending February 10.  She completed the full course and tolerated this fairly well.  Then in February she underwent a follow-up right mammogram which was about six-months from her bilateral mammogram, and there was a spot in the right breast that was concerning.  She underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy on February 16, 2010, and in reviewing this report, this was consistent with a tubular adenoma with fibrosis and apocrine metaplasia without malignancy.  It is recommended she have a right breast MRI in six-months, then in another six-months a mammogram, with alternating MRIs and mammograms every 6 months.  She had a previous history of a right breast stereotactic biopsy in September 2005.
For the last couple months she has also noticed intermittent rectal bleeding.  This was usually with wiping but occasionally in the stool.  She had never undergone a screening colonoscopy and had this performed on February 9, 2010.  In reviewing the report, she had a diminutive polyp in the ascending colon that was removed.  Per local pathology, this was a hyperplastic polyp.  She had a 6-mm sigmoid colon polyp removed with local pathology revealing a tubular adenoma.  We do not have those two pathology slides for review.  More concerning, she had a-1.5-cm raised rectal lesion approximately 2.5-cm proximal to the dentate line with pathology locally and here revealing grade 2 of 4 invasive adenocarcinoma.  Per our review, the depth of invasion could not be assessed on the small biopsy.  For some reason on our report it says the specimen was taken on February 2, 2010, but it was actually taken on February 9, 2010.  I think this is an error.  She has met with a surgeon locally and undergone extensive staging studies.  She underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on February 10, 2010.  This revealed symmetrical thickening of the rectal wall consistent with her tumor.  She also had a indeterminate 8-mm low-attenuation lesion in the left lobe of the liver but no lymphadenopathy was seen.  A PET CT-scan on February 24, has been reviewed which revealed no uptake of the low-attenuation lesion in the liver.  However, it also mentioned her rectal cancer was not metabolically active on the PET.  She had an endoscopic rectal ultrasound by a surgeon locally on March 5, 2010 revealing a T2, N0 rectal tumor.  It is mentioned that two-thirds of the lesion was relatively superficial extending only into the submucosa but one-third clearly extends to and is contiguous with the muscularis propria.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  The surgeon locally felt she would be a candidate for an abdominoperineal resection, but she is here for another opinion and for definitive surgery.
She has talked to her family members and has found out that a paternal grandfather had colon cancer and died of this at age 74.  She has a paternal aunt who had what sounds to be colon cancer as well as lung cancer (it is unsure which was primary) at age 67.  She had a brother who had an astrocytoma and died at age 53.  There is some question that he may have had neurofibromatosis.  Her mother passed away from a blood clot after she had surgery for a questionable ovarian cyst; however, the details are unclear.  It was unsure if the pathology revealed a malignancy.  She informs me that her mother's abdomen was quite large, so I am wondering if this may have been a tumor.  She is wondering about her genetic risks for colorectal cancer.  She has informed her siblings if they have not had colonoscopies to undergo screening.
Mrs. Smith is still having intermittent bleeding, but this is rare.  She denies rectal pain, abdominal pain, or significant weight-loss.  She actually gained 4 pounds during her radiation treatments for her breast cancer.  She has not really had a change in her bowel habits and has only been moving her bowels once-a-day.  She denies incontinence except when she is going through the bowel prep for her colonoscopy.  She has had no anorectal surgeries.  She has been a little more fatigued, but her fatigue has improved since she completed the radiation treatments recently.  She has not been anemic.
