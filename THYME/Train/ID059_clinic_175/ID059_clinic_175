#1 Metastatic colon cancer with known liver metastasis
The patient will receive cycle four of FOLFOX plus Avastin with omission of 5-FU bolus on the 6th of May.  She will return again on the 20th of May for her fifth cycle of chemotherapy.  She will be seen again by Dr. Mefford on the 3rd of June prior to her sixth cycle of treatment.  She seems to be responding both by CEA and radiologically and is tolerating the treatment well.  She uses Imodium for any slight diarrhea she experiences.
#2 History of neutropenia, chemotherapy-related
We are omitting bolus 5-FU
#3 Elevated blood pressure
The patient's blood pressure is elevated today.  This will need to be continuously monitored as she is on Avastin and also takes metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide.
#4 Thyroid nodules seen on CT-scan
This should be noted, and we will add-on thyroid function studies at this time, but we will not pursue an ultrasound given her metastatic colon cancer and the fact that she is undergoing chemotherapy at this time.
#5 Colon cancer at young-onset age
The patient has had MSI testing which showed MSI low and no evidence of HNPCC.  She has three children, and it was recommended that they begin screening colonoscopies at the age of 30.  I also offered her a medical genetics consultation as there are some other possibilities that could be explored such as MYH-associated polyposis or FAP.  She will decide if she would like to meet with Medical Genetics and let us know.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Ms.  Gentry is a 43-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer with known liver metastasis.  Currently undergoing chemotherapy with FOLFOX plus Avastin.  She returns today for consideration of her fourth cycle of chemotherapy.  Her oncologic history is summarized below as follows:
1. January 2010, patient reports a three- to four-month history of diarrhea.  She was found to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 6.
2. February 3, 2010, colonoscopy shows an enlarged near-obstructing mass in the ascending colon.  Biopsy consistent with invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
3. February 8, 2010, CT abdomen and pelvis shows a 7.1- x 7.2- x 9.1-cm mass in the ascending colon.  Multiple low-attenuation liver lesions in both lobes in the caudate lobe are noted as well, largest 3.3 cm.  Single enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node.  Also noted septate and cystic left adnexal mass measuring 5.4 x 4.8 x 6.3 cm.
4. February 12, 2010, due to the near-obstructing nature of her colon mass, patient underwent palliative right hemicolectomy.  Pathology found moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma, mass measuring 9.5 x 8 x 2.8-cm in the ascending colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolic fat, surgical margins negative.  Twenty-one of 34 lymph nodes positive for metastatic spread.  Bilateral oophorectomy shows benign findings.
5. March 18, 2010, patient began her first cycle of FOLFOX plus Avastin chemotherapy.
6. Patient received cycle three of chemotherapy after initial delay due to neutropenia on the 22nd of April.  She had omission of bolus at that time.
Since Ms. Gentry was treated on the 22nd of April, she notes that she is feeling significantly improved and denies any significant peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, shortness-of-breath, or change in bowel habits.  She did have some mild diarrhea, well-controlled with one-to-two Imodium following loose stools.  This only occurred a couple of days after chemotherapy.  She has also had a few nose sores, but no other complaints.  She denies any hand-foot syndrome.  She does have a runny nose for which she takes over-the-counter antihistamines as-needed.  She has not had any epistaxis.  Mrs. Delmonte does note in the last two days she has developed a slight tickle in her throat with mild hoarseness of her voice and some mild pain as well.  She has not had any fevers or chills.  She denies any cough.
