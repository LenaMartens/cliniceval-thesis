Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Poorly differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a nearly annular mass (8.8 x 5.3 x 2.8 cm) located in the ascending colon, 6.8 cm from the distal margin and 8.3 cm from the radial margin.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration.  Multiple (13 of 45) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Three of these lymph nodes show necrosis without viable tumor cells identified.

With available surgical material [AJCCpT3N2b, 7th edition].

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
