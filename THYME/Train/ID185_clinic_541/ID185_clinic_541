#1 Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon by the ileocecal valve
#2 Established coronary artery disease, status-post five-vessel bypass (2004)
#3 Severe COPD
#4 Chronic atrial fibrillation on systemic anticoagulation
I have reviewed the results of Mr. Burks's colon biopsy.  This reveals an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Burks contacted me this morning to discuss recommendations regarding anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation as well as whether or not it would be safe for him to proceed with a procedure.
I have reviewed with Mr. Burks that his nuclear stress test from July 12, 2010, demonstrated normal perfusion at stress and rest.  Additionally, his transthoracic echocardiogram from July 15, 2010, demonstrates preserved ejection fraction of 66% without regional wall motion abnormalities.  Additionally, he has no significant valvular heart disease.  Therefore, I believe it is medically acceptable for Mr. Burks to proceed with either an open or endovascular procedure.  Presently, I am uncertain as to what the operative approach will be.  Additionally, as Mr. Burks has preserved ejection fraction, no prior history of embolic phenomena, and no significant valvular disease, it would be acceptable for him to remain off Coumadin for the interim.  Postoperatively, I feel it would be acceptable to restart Coumadin at his outpatient dose without the need for intravenous or low-molecular-weight heparin bridging.  His atrial fibrillation is well rate-controlled, and I would recommend continuation of his present dose of diltiazem on the morning of the procedure.  In the interim, if Mr. Burks has any further questions, he is aware that he can contact me for further assistance.
