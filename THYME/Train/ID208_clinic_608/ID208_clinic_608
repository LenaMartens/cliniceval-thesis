Mrs. Ramos was initially diagnosed with a locally advanced cancer of the colon in the area of hepatic flexure with invasion of the duodenum.  A colon duodenal fistula was formed with ulceration in the duodenum and bleeding which was actually the primary symptom of the patient's disease.
At the time when the patient was diagnosed, I was involved in the management decision whether or not we would prefer preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downsize the tumor.  There was initial concern about the thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein which was suspicious for a tumor thrombus.  Fortunately the intra-operative findings did not show any tumor thrombus here.
The patient did go to surgery first with an en bloc resection of this large tumor and the involved organs including a Whipple resection.  She developed significant postoperative complications for which she has fortunately recovered nicely.  She is actually in pretty good performance status at this point in time.
I reviewed the stage of disease and the overall prognosis of patients with locally advanced, lymph node-positive colon cancer with the patient and her husband.  One complicating issue is that an omental metastases was resected which classifies the patient as a stage IV disease with an M1 tumor.  However, we do not have any evidence of residual tumor at this time so that the patient is, per definition, in the adjuvant indication, our goal of therapy is cure.
I reviewed the rationale and scale to use FOLFOX as adjuvant therapy in her situation.  The patient is aware of the fact that a port will need to be placed to allow the outpatient management of this treatment.  I would like to give the patient a little bit more time to recover and heal.  Our plan is to start chemotherapy on November 1 after Port-A-Cath placement.
I reviewed potential side-effects of this treatment including but not limited to myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and sensory neuropathy.  Mrs. Ramos voiced understanding.

Poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon with penetration into the duodenum and resected omental metastasis, pT4 N2 (5/53), M1 - Molecular markers: MSS, KRAS wild-type.

1.  July 2010 - Malaise, and nausea and vomiting and weakness, Hb of 5.5 g/dL.
2.  August 12, 2010 - CT abdomen/pelvis, EGD. Large colon mass in hepatic flexure  invading into the duodenum causing a bleeding ulceration and fistulous communication between the duodenum and the ascending colon. No overt liver metastases, but non-occlusive thrombus in the superior portion of the superior
mesenteric vein which extends into the main portal vein. Colonoscopy confirms partially obstructing mass at the hepatic flexure.
3.  September 3, 2010 - En bloc extended right hemicolectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, with cholecystectomy , end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy (duct-to-mucosa), end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy, end-to-side duodenojejunostomy, intraabdominal omental pedicle flap (Drs. Cima and Donohue). Pathology:  Poorly grade 4 (of 4) poorly-differentiated  adenocarcinoma forming a 13.5 x 11.5 x 11.0 cm ulcerating mass in  the transverse colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and  directly invades adjacent duodenum and focally the pancreas. Angiolymphatic invasion is present.  Surgical resection margins are negative.  Multiple (5 of 53) regional  lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  The grossly described nodule in the omentum shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.
4.  Postoperative course complicated by anastomotic leak and sepsis as well as acute coronary syndrome of unknown cause with transient reduction of the LVEF to 30-35%.
Mrs. Ramos is a very pleasant 50-year-old patient whose oncologic history is outlined above.  She is now being referred to Medical Oncology to discuss potential treatment options for her locally advanced colon cancer.  Upon presentation today, she stated that she is still recovering from the surgery and the postoperative complications.  Her intra-abdominal drain was removed about two days ago.  She still has some wound dehiscence in the area of the laparotomy.  No fever, no signs of infection.  No pain.  No diarrhea.  Her bowel movements have improved from perioperative diarrhea to now more semi-solid state, and she has about one bowel movement a day.
