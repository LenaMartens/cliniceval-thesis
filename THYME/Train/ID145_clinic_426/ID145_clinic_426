#1 Probably sigmoid cancer, questionable metastases
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Lehmann, who also met with Mrs. Martinez and her husband.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient is scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, CT colonography, PET scan, outside CT abdomen and pelvis March 25, 2010, reading.  We will get her outside tissue and tissue block for reading and IHC testing.  The patient is scheduled for Colon and Rectal Surgery, and depending on CT colonography and PET scan findings, patient may need to see Medical Oncology.  Whether or not she has metastases, she may very well need surgery to prevent obstruction.  Patient is OK anesthesia in my estimation with no cardiopulmonary issues.  She has no chest pain or shortness-of-breath and exercises frequently.

#1 Sigmoid cancer
Mrs. Martinez is a 38-year-old female who since around Christmastime has had intermittent abdominal cramping, change in bowel habits with ribbon-like stools.  She had one episode of blood in the toilet bowl.  She has lost 25 pounds intentionally due to exercise and dieting.  No abnormal weight-loss.  Appetite good.  Colonoscopy March 22, 2010, was only to 20 cm where a strictured tumor affect noted.  This was biopsied.  I am told this was cancer, but I do not have the outside pathology.  A CT-scan on March 25, 2010, of abdomen and pelvis showed upper sigmoid colon involving approximately 5- to 6-cm in length mural mass.  There was also adjacent to this in the posterior pericolonic fat a conglomeration of regional lymph node metastases.  This extended into the lower retroperitoneum at the level of the aortic bifurcation.  There were two small low-attenuation lesions in the posterior right hepatic lobe, indeterminate, but suspicious for hepatic metastases.  Patient now comes to Blakely House Health Care Center for further evaluation of the above.
