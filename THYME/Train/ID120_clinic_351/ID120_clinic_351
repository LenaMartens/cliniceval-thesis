#1 Recurrent colorectal cancer to the right pelvic sidewall
I have reviewed all of the above in-depth with LoriAnne as well as my collaborating physician today.  Presently, overall, she is doing exceptionally well on her neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Xeloda and radiation.  I would not recommend any further dosage adjustments at this point.  I will see her back on May 10, 2010, for further evaluation right before her surgery.  She knows of course if there are problems that occur in the interim to call.  She does understand that she may need further chemotherapy after her surgery, but we will discuss this when we have more results from her surgery and pathology.
#2 PAME
I have reviewed LoriAnne's situation, and I did not see any significant reason why she would not tolerate her therapy well.  She has a CT-scan and chest x-ray ordered which pending the results of that would determine her overall ability to withstand the surgery.  At this point, however, her only significant risk factor would be her multiple thrombolytic events, but these have all been related to central line placement.  She has never had a problem with postoperative thrombolysis, but one needs to be cognizant of her history in the postoperative setting.  At this point, though, she would be medically acceptable for the planned procedure of resection of her recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Collaborating physician:  Dr. Ashley Coleman.

Mrs. Taylor is a very pleasant 41-year-old female from 18331.
1.  April 2006, developed change in bowel habits and abdominal cramping.
2.  April 13, 2006, colonoscopy identifying a rectosigmoid mass.
3.  April 19, 2006, underwent low-anterior resection with positive radial margin, T3 tumor, N0 (0 of 14 lymph nodes), 6-cm in size, K-ras positive.
4.  June 2006 to August 2006, bolus 5-FU plus leucovorin.
5.  August 21, 2006, to September 28, 2006, radiation for a total dose of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions.
6.  October 2006 to December 2006, bolus 5-FU and leucovorin.  Developed Port-A-Cath-associated clot, anticoagulated.
7.  December 2006 to August 2008, no evidence of disease recurrence.
8.  August 2008, elevated CEA to 6.1.  CT/PET scan showing suspicious area in the right adnexal region.  CT-guided biopsy suspicious but nondiagnostic.
9.  October 8, 2008, total abdominal hysterectomy and BSO.  Per operative note, right adnexal mass adherent to the lateral pelvic sidewall in the area of ureteral stricture.  Developed DVT associated with central line.  PICC line placed.
10.  November 2008 to March 2009, FOLFOX plus Avastin times ten cycles.  Had extensive nausea and vomiting not responsive to Compazine, not given any other antiemetics.  Also developed neuropathy in the hands and feet.
11.  March 2009, developed DVT associated with PICC line, removed.
12.  November 2009, small-bowel obstruction.
13.  January 2010, elevated CEA and small-bowel obstruction.
14.  January 16, 2010, taken for resection.  Surgery aborted due to extensive adhesions, but biopsies obtained of right pelvic sidewall mass confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Underwent bypass of small-bowel.
15.  March 22, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Coleman of Medical Oncology, Dr. Quiroga of Radiation Oncology, and Dr. Young of Colon and Rectal Surgery with joint consensus to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation with hopeful surgical resection with IORT.  Due to Mrs. Taylor's multiple problems with thrombosis from PICC lines and central catheters, Dr. Coleman deemed infusional 5-FU inappropriate and recommended Xeloda as a radiosensitizer.
16.  April 21, 2010, Xeloda plus concurrent radiation treatment.
17.  Radiation initiated.  Due to multiple insurance problems, Xeloda not able to be started until April 27, 2010.
Mrs. Taylor returns in the outpatient setting for further evaluation and treatment of her recurrent colorectal cancer.  Presently, overall, she notes since initiating Xeloda she has overall had very minimal side-effects.  She has not noticed an increase in her bowel pattern but continues on Paregoric and Lomotil three times a day.  She always has diarrhea, but this has been persistent since her bypass surgery, and she has up to seven bowel movements a day which again is her baseline pattern.  She has no abdominal or pelvic pain and only uses Norco one tablet once-a-day at night to help sleep.  She has a good appetite and has maintained her weight relatively well, however, over the last two-weeks she has lost an additional 5 pounds.  She notes overall she is eating well, however.  She has had no hand/foot syndrome.  She has no mucositis or stomatitis.  She has no fevers or night sweats.  She has noticed a decreased energy level and naps during the day but sleeps well at night as well.  She has no shortness-of-breath, chest pain, or peripheral edema.  She notes the pain she was previously experiencing in her abdomen has resolved.
