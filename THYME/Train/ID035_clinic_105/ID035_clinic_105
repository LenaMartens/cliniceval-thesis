#1 Resected stage III rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N1, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Omar Muse' Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Jared Torres, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
Mrs. Sturges will be following-up in Arlington and therefore I will not make return evaluation appointments at Weber Memorial Hospital in Illinois, Lake Oswego; however, I will make follow-up appointments for her in Arlington, Lake Oswego.  This will include a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel, and evaluation with medical and radiation oncology.  I will asked Dr. Torres to visit with her prior to dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.
