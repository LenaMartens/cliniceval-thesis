Mrs. Miller is a 74-year-old woman who has a one-year history of hematochezia and a 30-pound weight-loss.  She underwent her first colonoscopy January 29, 2010, which demonstrated an ulcerated mass in the low to mid rectum.  Additionally, a villous 5-cm neoplasm was noted just inside the dentate.  Pathology from mid rectum biopsies demonstrated invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in tubulovillous adenoma, and biopsies from the distal rectum demonstrated tubulovillous adenocarcinoma with focal areas highly suggestive of mucinous adenocarcinoma. Staging CT abdomen and pelvis and chest x-ray was negative for obvious metastatic disease. She started preoperative neoadjuvant therapy but it was not well-tolerated. She developed a DVT and is currently anticoagulated. She comes now for surgical management of her rectal cancer.
