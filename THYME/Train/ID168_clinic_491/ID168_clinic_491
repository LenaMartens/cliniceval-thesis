This is a 51-year-old gentleman from the Iowa area who is presenting for probable rectal carcinoma with the findings of a left renal mass and left adrenal gland enlargement on an outside CT-scan.
#1 Presumed rectal adenocarcinoma
Given his family history, age, and the possibility of multiple primary malignancies, this does raise a concern of a genetic predisposition.  This was discussed at length with him.  Genetic testing was also discussed in terms of evaluating for the presence of mismatch repair genes.  He was given a cost summary of these tests, and he will be looking into whether his insurance will cover them.  He is interested in pursuing if this is the case.  In regard to further evaluation of the rectal cancer, he will need to be appropriately staged.  We will review the CT-scan performed at the outside facility of his abdomen and pelvis.  We will perform a CT of his chest and perform an endorectal ultrasound.  We will also perform routine blood tests, and he already has an appointment to see Dr. Grim in Colorectal Surgery.  In addition, out of concern of metastatic disease versus multiple primaries, Dr. Nord recommended pursuing a PET scan as well, and we will arrange this.
#2 Left renal mass
This is concerning for a renal cell carcinoma.  We will perform an MRI of his abdomen to evaluate further, perform an urinalysis, and place a referral for an Urology consult.  He will also require orbital plain films given his history as a welder.
#3 Left adrenal gland enlargement
Etiology of this is less clear.  This could be evidence of metastatic disease versus adrenal adenoma versus hyperplasia versus some artifact secondary to the left renal mass.  The MRI will help us sort this out further.  However, we will do some functional studies to rule-out pheochromocytoma in particular and do a 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines.  We will also check a renin level and an AM cortisol.
#4 Tobaccoism
We will refer to Nicotine Dependence for counseling.
We will see him back once the tests are complete.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at Porter Health Center.

Mr. Harris is a pleasant 51-year-old gentleman who has been relatively healthy aside from the below issues.
#1 Presumed rectal adenocarcinoma
He was in his usual state of health until approximately three weeks ago when he began to note maroon to bright-red blood per rectum.  This was often not mixed in with stool.  He began to pass frequent bloody, mucousy stools.  He initially attributed this to hemorrhoids.  However, after three weeks he sought further evaluation by his local physicians.  On May 3, 2010, a colonoscopy was performed (this was his first screening colonoscopy).  It noted a mass 10-cm from the anal verge.  It was approximately 5-cm in length and a diameter of 30-mm.  The scope was able to be passed through the lesion and reach the ileocecal valve without difficulty.  The pathology specimen has been sent here and is pending review, but per outside report, it did confirm adenocarcinoma.  He denied any additional symptoms at that time including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, or change in his stool caliber.  He denies any weight-loss as well.  A CT-scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed and was notable for a 5.8- x 4.1-cm mass on his left kidney that was concerning for renal cell carcinoma.  In addition, his left adrenal gland was enlarged at 1.4-cm.  The radiology report from the outside facility did not comment on enhancement.  Also, there was some thickening of the bowel wall near the rectum but no evidence of invasion to the side wall or adjacent structures.
