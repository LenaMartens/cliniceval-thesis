#1 Dilated esophagus on CT-scan
#2 Adenocarcinoma right colon
#3 Symptomatic anemia
#4 Hypothyroidism
Miss Mullins is a very pleasant 91-year-old with a recent diagnosis of colon cancer who is scheduled to undergo a right hemicolectomy next week.  Her imaging studies have incidentally revealed a dilated esophagus with concern for distal thickening, raising the question of  achalasia versus pseudoachalasia.  Miss Mullins has little in the way of symptoms for achalasia.  It would be unusual for colonic colon cancer to metastasize to the distal esophagus.  Given these considerations, it is possible that this is just a dilated esophagus related to age-related changes.  Nonetheless, it does warrant further evaluation, especially since she is scheduled to undergo surgery next week.  If she were to have achalasia, she would be at higher risk of aspiration postoperatively; and it would be prudent to treat her prior to the surgery.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  EGD as a complex procedure.  If there is evidence of an abnormality at the lower end of the esophagus, biopsies can be obtained.  In addition, the procedure should be ordered as a complex procedure so a Botox injection can be done at the discretion of the endoscopist at the same time.
I have explained this plan to both Miss Mullins and the primary team.  She is dismissed today.  She will likely get her EGD either Monday or Tuesday and then is planning on coming back to the hospital on Wednesday for her surgery.  If follow-up in the GI Clinic is necessary in the future, I would be happy to see her in my clinic.
This is a fellow note and has been staffed with Dr. Cornelius.  Please call (05316) with questions.

Miss Mullins is a very pleasant 91-year-old who is currently hospitalized with a new diagnosis of colon cancer.  Miss Mullins was noted to have symptomatic anemia for which she was admitted and underwent a colonoscopy on December 18, 2009.  Colonoscopy showed a malignant mass in the proximal ascending/distal cecum with biopsies showing poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  As part of the staging evaluation, she underwent a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis which in addition to showing the irregular thickening of the cecum also showed a markedly dilated esophagus with some distal thickening raising the question of achalasia versus pseudoachalasia.  Miss Mullins is scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hemicolectomy with Dr. Wadsworth this upcoming Wednesday and we are being consulted for further management of the dilated esophagus that has been noted on CT-scan.
Miss Mullins notes that she feels quite well.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, or dysphagia.  She has had some problems with GERD in the past; however, this does not seem to be particularly bothersome for her.  No history of cough or aspiration pneumonias.
