Mr. Thomason is a pleasant 54-year-old gentleman who four years ago was found to have a cecal cancer and underwent right hemicolectomy.  During surveillance ultrasound this year, he was found to have a metachronous colonic adenocarcinoma in his transverse colon.  During the staging of this cancer, he was found to have a couple of indeterminate liver lesions.  He comes now for surgical management of  this colon cancer.
