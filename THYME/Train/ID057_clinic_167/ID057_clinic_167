DATA
Per her outside lab work, her albumin on April 14, 2010, was low at 3.0 with a total protein at 5.1.  Other lab results discussed above.
IMPRESSION
#1 Likely ascending colon cancer
Discussed with Mrs. Prime and her family that this would be a big operation if she undergoes a right hemicolectomy.  There is some discrepancy whether this is actually in the descending colon or what is the exact situation as she had prior colon surgery.  It may be important to do another colonoscopy as there was no tattooing performed, but I will let her meet with one of our surgeons, and we will review her outside CT-scan first to see if this really needs to be performed as this would be quite difficult for her as she is frail and has limited mobility at this time.  We will get a CEA.  I discussed with the family that if this could be done partially laparoscopically, she would likely be hospitalized three to five days if everything else goes smooth or five to seven days for an open operation.  I do agree with them that she would likely need skilled nursing facility placement following surgery if we end up proceeding this route.  The family and the patient had a long discussion, and they would like to proceed with evaluation for definitive surgery for her but will make their final decision following her preoperative evaluation and seeing Cardiology.  I discussed with her if our outside review of her CT-scan is concerning for possible liver mets, we may need an abdominal ultrasound.  I did discuss with the family if they decided not to proceed with a large surgery to definitively treat this, at times we can put in a colonic stent, although on the right-side I am not sure whether this is easily feasible, or sometimes we divert with just a diverting ileostomy so that she would not obstruct.  They asked specific questions about additional options instead of the large abdominal surgery if she is not medically able to undergo this.  We will also get chest x-ray.
#2 Coronary artery disease
For preoperative clearance we will send to Cardiology.  She has not had a recent cardiac evaluation.  We will get a baseline EKG.  Give her an updated prescription for nitroglycerin.
#3 Dementia, Alzheimer's versus vascular dementia
Her son is the POA.
#4 Labile hypertension
This was well-controlled today.  We will allow Cardiology to weigh in.  It may be improved since the adjustment of her medication.
#5 Hypothyroidism
Will get updated TSH.
#6 Hyperlipidemia
Stable.
#7 History of carotid stenosis
We will hold her Aggrenox and aspirin at this time during her evaluation.
#8 Anemia secondary to No. 1
We will get a repeat type and screen and a CBC to see if she will need additional transfusions.
#9 Sleep disorder
She will continue on her Tylenol at this time.
#10 Congestive heart failure
Will get a BNP with her labs.
#11 B12 deficiency
Stable.
#12 Depression and anxiety
She as well as her family feel her mood is stable.  No changes to her medication.
#13 Fecal incontinence
She may move her bowels more often if we have surgery, but at this point I do not think there is any reason to do a colostomy if this is a right-sided cancer.
#14 History of UTI/urinary incontinence
Continue on nitrofurantoin.
#15 Chronic kidney disease
We will get updated BUN, creatinine.  Will check magnesium and calcium in addition to regular potassium, sodium, and electrolytes.
#16 Pressure ulcer, stage 1
Discussed with the family that the DuoDerm will need to be kept on, and we will need to watch this.  Discussed with the patient and family she will need to readjust herself in the chair and change positions frequently to try to get more circulation to this area.  We will need to watch.
#17 PAME
We will send her to Cardiology for clearance.
#18 Hypoalbuminemia
We will recheck this as well as a total protein.
Spent 120 minutes with Mrs. Prime, her two sons, and her daughter.  Long discussion and reviewed 30+ pages of outside medical records.  I will see them back after her evaluation with one of our surgeons to discuss in more detail the advantages and risks of proceeding and what her risks are from a cardiac and medical perspective.  Will not put her on the surgical list at this time.  All questions were answered.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at Lakeside Hospital Medical Center.  She does have a copy of these, and her power of attorney (son) will bring a copy of this from the car when she returns for a subsequent visit.

Mrs. Prime is seen at the request of Dr. Carrell for evaluation of an ascending colon cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mrs. Prime is an Oregon-year-old female from New Castle, who was recently hospitalized for anemia and a suspected GI bleed on April 9, 2010.  Approximately six-months earlier, she had undergone some type of colon evaluation including a barium enema.  A lot of the history is gathered from Mrs. Prime, but she has either vascular or Alzheimer's-type dementia, and has an activated power of attorney who is her son, Nbtmkix Jkoy, and a lot of the history is gathered through her family.  This included her son who is the POA, as well as her other son whom she lives with, Dqyx Eizu, and her daughter.  Apparently, she underwent a barium enema for colon evaluation as in 2005 on her last colonoscopy it was recommended she undergo a follow-up colon evaluation.  From the family's report, no one was concerned about the findings on the barium enema at-home.  I think it revealed diverticulosis in reviewing her outside records (a review by providers of the study), but there was nothing concerning that the family was aware of regarding the test.  She then came in for a routine follow-up on April 8, 2010, to Dr. Carrell with complaints of weakness and fatigue.  Blood work was obtained after she left the clinic that night, and her hemoglobin was 7.3.  She then went to the hospital at the request of Dr. Carrell and as part of her evaluation for GI bleeding underwent a colonoscopy on April 12, 2010.  This revealed a-1-cm polyp immediately adjacent to the appendiceal orifice which was removed with pathology reviewed here and consistent with a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  Several centimeters distal to the ileocecal valve a mass was noted in the right colon.  This was photographed and biopsied, but not tattooed.  It is not mentioned exactly how large this was, although it seemed to occupy at least one-third of the circumference of the colon and was non-obstructing.  Pathology reviewed here reveals invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features associated with a tubulovillous adenoma. There was no evidence of diverticulitis.  She had pandiverticulosis, moderate in the sigmoid colon..
She also had an upper EGD at that time which revealed a hiatal hernia and several areas of hyperemia suggestive of possible minimal gastritis or superficial erosions.  Biopsy performed locally revealed this was negative for H. pylori.  Here the pathology slides were consistent with intestinal metaplasia.  She had three blood transfusions, and on April 15 before discharge her hemoglobin was 11.8.  She met with a surgeon in the hospital, but she and her family did not feel comfortable with this surgeon, and therefore, they are here for another opinion.
Interestingly, Mrs. Prime has a prior history of colon cancer in 1968.  In reviewing her records and in discussing with her, it is thought that maybe this was actually a cecal cancer.  However, on her colonoscopy on the 12th, it was pretty clear that the cecum was "clearly identified with visualization of the ileocecal valve", making it unlikely that she actually had a cecal resection or right hemicolectomy previously.  She apparently had a colostomy temporarily after the surgery which was subsequently taken down.  She did not receive adjuvant treatment and has no other family history of colorectal cancer.  She used to move her bowels once-a-day, but now it is about once every-other-day.  She has not had abdominal bloating.  She denies abdominal pain.  She has some fecal incontinence which has been going on a couple years, and she wears Depends.  At times she can make it to the bathroom.  She has not noticed bright-red blood per rectum.  She had not really had other symptoms except for the profound anemia with associated weakness and fatigue.  She denies recent abdominal pain or significant weight-loss.  Her appetite had been stable.  Her family reports that she had been in a pretty good state of health for the last six-months up until her recent hospitalization.  She currently resides with her son, Dqyx Eizu, as she is widowed.  They feel they have been managing things well with this living arrangement, although she has been a lot weaker since getting out of the hospital.  She was just discharged on the 14th and had a follow-up in the office on the 15th of April.  Her Aggrenox, which she had been on for a history of cerebrovascular disease and carotid stenosis, has been held since her hospitalization and her 325 of aspirin which she generally takes.  A CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained locally on April 14th.  We do not yet have those images here to review, but per local review, this revealed a-1.5-cm polypoid filling defect in the lateral wall of the descending colon.  I am wondering if this is a typo, but in this final report supposedly of her CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, the descending colon is mentioned twice, although it is mentioned she had polypoid thickening along the lateral wall of the proximal descending colon measuring approximately 1.5-cm in diameter just distal to the ileocecal valve so I am wondering if this is meant to be ascending, but there are two aspects in this report where it is mentioned as descending.  She also had six low-attenuation lesions seen throughout the liver with the largest being 2.4-cm that are suspected to be consistent with cysts.  She had cholelithiasis.  She has never had gallbladder symptoms.  She did not have a CEA done locally.
In reviewing Mrs. Prime's outside records and hospitalization, it was mentioned she was a DNR.  I brought this up with the patient and the family to clarify whether this is the case or what the goals of her care are at this time.  After a 20-minute discussion regarding code status, the patient and the family tell me they did not understand what the DNR meant and did not feel that they made this decision specifically while she was in the hospital, and they would like her to be a full code.  At this point it is uncertain whether she has a terminal illness, and therefore, they are comfortable and want to proceed with evaluation for possible surgery for her cancer and then decide based on the risks versus benefits with her other comorbidities whether this would be appropriate and consider her quality of life.
Mrs. Prime was seen here in 2007 in Neurology and diagnosed with dementia compatible with either multi-infarct dementia or Alzheimer's disease.  Her sons report they have been activated as her powers of attorney for approximately three years.  Although she is still able to do a lot of things on her own as far as certain ADLs and make certain decision, the large decisions are made by her power of attorney, her son, Nbtmkix Jkoy, and then Dqyx Eizu, her other son, is the secondary power of attorney who lives with her.  She had been doing quite well and generally was fairly independent with her ADLs up until her recent hospitalization.  Since her recent hospitalization, she has needed more assistance.  She uses a walker to ambulate, and she is able to walk about 30 steps.  She cannot traverse stairs well, although with the help of her son and a railing, she is able to go up the four to five stairs into their home.  She has not had recent falls.  The family is under the impression that she will likely need to be placed in a skilled nursing facility following surgery if this ends up having surgery.  She has been a lot weaker since she got out of the hospital.  She needs assistance making meals, housekeeping, and with toileting.  She is able to dress herself generally per her son's report.  She can feed herself.  She also can bathe herself, and they have a shower chair in the home at this time.  Her son manages her medications for her.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1..  New ascending colon cancer with previous history of colon cancer.  It is not exactly clear whether this is ascending, although this is what I can gather from her information, although there is some discrepancy on her outside report of whether this is descending. Discussed above.
2.  Dementia, Alzheimer's versus vascular dementia.  Currently, POA is activated as discussed above.
3.  Depression with anxiety.  She has been on sertraline for approximately a year-and-a-half to two years.  She informs me today her mood is stable.  She denies suicidal ideation.  Her family also thinks she is stable in regard to this, although, of course, she is concerned about the news of malignancy.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.  No recent changes to medication.
5.  Coronary artery disease.  She is status-post three-vessel CABG here in 1995.  She then subsequently had a non-Q-wave MI in 2001.  An angiogram at that time in March 2001 revealed that her bypass grafts were patent, and the right middle coronary artery was 100% occluded, the proximal right coronary artery was 30% occluded, the first obtuse marginal branch was 70% obstructed, the distal circumflex was 40% obstructed, the proximal circumflex was 70% obstructed, the middle left anterior descending was 100% occluded, proximal left anterior descending was 50% obstructed, and the left main coronary artery was 60% obstructed.  It does not appear intervention was performed at that time.  Her last echocardiogram in our records was from March 2005 which revealed an ejection fraction of 65% with grade 2/4 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressures.  She had normal left ventricular size and no regional wall motion abnormalities.  She had moderate mitral valve regurg, a patent foramen ovale, and mild pulmonary hypertension.  She reports not having a recent cardiac evaluation.  She did use nitroglycerin two-months ago for chest pain that radiated to the left-side.
6.  Labile hypertension.  In reviewing her outside reports, it was mentioned she had labile hypertension.  It was said during her hospitalization her systolics would vary and go up into the 190s.  Her son checks this occasionally and says at times this is elevated.  She did have an increase in her amlodipine recently when she was hospitalized from 3.5 to 5-mg.
7.  Congestive heart failure.  She has not been hospitalized specifically for congestive heart failure.  Has evidence of diastolic dysfunction as discussed on her echo in 2005.  She has stable chronic lower-extremity edema.
8.  B12 deficiency.  She is taking a daily supplement.
9.  Hypothyroidism.  Stable.
10.  Distant history of hepatitis.  Back in 1953, she became jaundiced and had hepatitis.  She is unaware of long-term sequelae.
11.  Chronic kidney disease, Stage III with a creatinine of 1.4 and a BUN of 20 in the hospital around April 14th with an estimated GFR of 36. I believe this was before her CT-scan.
12.  Osteoporosis.
13.  Degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine and lumbar spine.
14.  Carotid stenosis.  She has had multiple carotid endarterectomies, twice to the right-side and once to the left. An updated carotid ultrasound in February 007 which did not reveal significant restenosis.
15.  Sleep disorder.  She had been on Ambien, but this was stopped in the hospital, and she has been taking Tylenol at night to help her sleep which has been working.
16.  Urinary incontinence.  She wears Depends as she has issues with urinary incontinence.  She has had problems with urinary tract infections and is on prophylactic nitrofurantoin.  It has been over six-months since she had an infection.  She is not symptomatic currently.
17.  Fecal incontinence.  Discussed above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Some kind of surgery as a child which resulted in left facial drooping.
2.  Tubal ligation.
3.  Colon resection for colon cancer, 1968.  Details unclear. Had temporary colostomy which was subsequently reversed.
4.  Three-vessel CABG, 1995.
5.  Right carotid endarterectomy, 1991.  She developed a restenosis and had this repeated here in 1992.  In 1997, she had a left carotid endarterectomy.
6.  Bilateral cataract extractions.
