Mrs. True is a 48-year-old woman who initially was diagnosed with sigmoid cancer in September of 2003.  After a course of chemoradiation using Xeloda, an LAR was performed in 2004.  At the time the disease was stage T3, N0 (0 out of 15).  A hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was also performed.  Unfortunately, the postoperative course was complicated by wound infection.  In March of 2005, a PET CT showed a nodule in the lung.  In June of 2005, this was resected.  She started adjuvant therapy with FOLFOX and Avastin in October of 2005.  Until now, there had been no evidence of recurrence of disease.  The most recent CT-scan was in November of 2009 and did not show any evidence of disease.  On July 26, 2009, a colonoscopy showed inflammation at the anastomosis site; biopsy did not reveal any sign of malignancy.  However, it was worrisome that her CEA had climbed to 14.3.  Subsequently, a PET CT on August 4, 2010, showed a new soft-tissue mass in the right pelvis.  A CT-scan on August 6, showed mild hydronephrosis and confirmed the mass in the right pelvis near the right common iliac bifurcation.
Mrs. True now comes to Shanti for a second opinion regarding further treatment.  I explained to her that to complete the diagnostic workup, a biopsy proving recurrent disease might be required.  Because of the somewhat complicated location of the mass seen on CT-scan, Ms. Foster discussed this case with Dr. Bennett who did not feel that endoscopic ultrasound would make the mass accessible.  Mrs. True will also be evaluated later today by Dr. Nieman to discuss surgical options.  We will also ask our colleagues from Radiation Oncology to take part in this team effort.  Since according to the PET CT the pelvis seems to be the only site of disease, aggressive surgical resection, maybe with intraoperative radiation, might result in a cure.
