#1 Rectosigmoid cancer and synchronous adenoma at the hepatic flexure
Mrs. Sternberg presents for further evaluation and treatment of colorectal cancer.  I discussed the development, staging, and treatment of colorectal cancer with her as well as Lynch syndrome given the development of these growths in her bowel at such a young age.  We will proceed with lab work, chest x-ray, ECG, and CT abdomen and pelvis for staging purposes, as well as EUS and colonoscopy to assess for nodal involvement and confirm the location as sigmoid and not rectal.  Patient will then meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery for surgical recommendations.  She is also agreeable to immunohistochemistry staining to assess for Lynch syndrome.  Brochures given.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG (given her history of occasional heart palpitation) are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, the patient is OK for anesthesia.
Discussed with Dr. Kerry Snow, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mrs. Sternberg is a delightful 43-year-old woman who presents for further treatment of rectosigmoid cancer.  Mrs. Sternberg developed hematochezia and underwent her first colonoscopy February 15, 2010.  A 2-mm polyp was removed from the hepatic flexure (tubular adenoma low-grade dysplasia), and a large broad-based sessile mass was noted in the distal sigmoid colon described at 15-cm.  This mass was biopsied and tattooed.  Pathology demonstrated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  No further staging has been performed.  Mrs. Sternberg offers no other complaints, including no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight-loss, fever, hematochezia, melena, diarrhea, constipation, or change in bowel habits.  She does note feeling more abdominal fullness over recent years.
Mrs. Sternberg has no chronic comorbidities.  There is no history of nicotine dependence, thrombosis, heart attack, stroke, cardiopulmonary condition, medication allergy, glaucoma, or sleep apnea.  She has no history of anesthesia reactions or bleeding disorders.
