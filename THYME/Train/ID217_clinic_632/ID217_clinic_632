#1 A 59-year-old gentleman with no family history of colon cancer, now with a recently-diagnosed sigmoid colon malignancy
The biopsies have been reviewed and reveal an adenocarcinoma.
I think it will be very important for us to determine exactly where this is located, to make certain this is in the sigmoid colon, and not in the proximal rectum.  The CT-scan also suggested his right adrenal gland was enlarged, we will confirm this by a repeat CT-scan of the adrenal gland.  Depending on these results, I will see the patient in return with Colorectal Surgical consultation.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Mr. Miguel is a very pleasant 59-year-old retired lrpay hewd bfdxeg from Iowa, Roberts.  He underwent a colonoscopy recently for evaluation of small-volume rectal outlet bleeding, and a ulcerated lesion that was thought by the surgeon to represent a carcinoma was found in the sigmoid colon, approximately 25 cm from the anal verge, according to the outside report.  Biopsies showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The patient underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen, and other than a right adrenal gland that appeared to be enlarged, there were no concerns for metastatic cancer.  Tubular adenoma was removed from the rectum at the same time as well.
The patient wished to undergo his evaluation at the Leominster County Infirmary, including surgical consideration.
He has no family history of colon cancer.  His risk factors are really quite minimal, in that he does not smoke, and consumes alcohol on a very limited basis.
His medical history is notable only for mild hypertension, and mild hyperlipidemia, both on treatment.
