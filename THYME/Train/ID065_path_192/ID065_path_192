Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.2 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass in the ascending colon.  Tumor invades through muscular wall.  Lymphovascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (40) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
