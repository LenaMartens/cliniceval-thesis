Final Diagnosis
A.  Perihepatic region, right, excision:  Metastatic grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colon primary, forming a 6.0 x 5.0 4.0 cm well circumscribed cystic mass filled almost entirely with mucin and surrounded by a fibrous wall.

B.  Lymph node, mid colic, biopsy:  A single lymph node is negative for tumor.

C.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (5.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm) located at the ileocecal valve invading through the muscular propria into the pericolic fat, 13.0 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 11) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma and show extranodal extension.  The appendix demonstrates associated serosal adhesions and chronic inflammation. [AJCC pT3N1bM1].  Seen in consultation with Dr. Drew T. Mcclellan

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right perihepatic cyst"" is a 6.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm cystic mass with dark yellow gelatinous contents.  Photograph taken.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PRATER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""mid colic node"" is a 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by PRATER.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, appendix, right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 13.0 cm of terminal ileum, 21.0 cm of colon, and a 4.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm appendix.  A 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm polypoid mass is present within the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The mass is 13.0 cm from the proximal ileal mucosal margin and 0.5 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PRATER.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Perihepatic region, right, excision:  Fibrous walled cyst filled with gelatinous material; favor benign, but can not rule out malignancy.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Lori K. Phares, M.D.

B.  Lymph node, mid colic, biopsy:  A single lymph node is negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Leslie Coleman, M.D.

C.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (5.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm) located at the ileocecal valve, 13.0 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  Multiple (2 of 11) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma and show extranodal extension.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Leslie Coleman, M.D.
