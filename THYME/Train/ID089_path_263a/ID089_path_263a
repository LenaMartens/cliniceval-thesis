Final Diagnosis
A.  Skin, anal tags, excision:  Fibroepithelial polyps.

B.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) with treatment effect, forming a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm ulcerative mass in the rectum (50% tumor viability).  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  The tumor extends to within 2.4 cm of the radial resection margin.  A separate mesenteric satellite nodule (1.7 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm) of viable moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is identified.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. Multiple (3 of 24) regional lymph nodes show mucin pools with no viable tumor cells consistent with treated metastasis, see comment [AJCCypT3N0MX].
 
C.  Rectum, rectal ring, excision:  Unremarkable rectal anastomotic ring (1.3 cm in length) identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Pat J. Baker



Diagnosis Comment
There are three regional lymph nodes containing mucin pools which represent treated tumor, with no evidence of viable tumor cells.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled anal skin (tags) is a 2.5 x 2.1 x 0.4 cm aggregate of multiple (4)  grossly unremarkable tan skin tags.  All submitted for permanent sections.  Grossed by FUCHS.

B.  Received fresh labeled rectosigmoid junction is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of a 23.3 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon and rectum.  A 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 2.2 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin, puckering the serosal surface, and 2.4 cm from the radial margin. The deepest extent of the tumor is 1.3 cm and tumor perforation is absent. Multiple (29) potential lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat with the largest lymph node measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MACK.

C.  Received fresh labeled rectal ring is a 1.3 cm segment of rectal ring.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by MACK.

Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Marion Saxton, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded rectal tissue (block B4).  Upon completion, results will be available in WKTV JzovMnbb.


Slide Disposition
2/2/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for k-ras mutation analysis at request of Dr. Lindsey Crist/lawrence
