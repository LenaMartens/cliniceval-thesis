Mrs. Webb has had her PET scan.  It shows uptake consistent with findings on CT-scan at the umbilicus and in the right abdominal wall.  She does have a moderate amount of uptake in the deep pelvis which is suspicious.
She will undergo abdominal exploration, excision of abdominal and umbilical lesions, which are probably mets, and resection of the rectal cancer.

1. February 4, 2008, exploratory surgery performed in Illinois where the surgeon states there was a mass that was fractured off the psoas muscle that left behind extension of tumor in the retroperitoneum.  He did remove the entire mesentery of the right colon.  Further exploration revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon as well as an additional retroperitoneal mass.  Pathology of the right peritoneal and left pelvic peritoneum positive for adenocarcinoma.  Right colon with the adherent right ovary was positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma located at the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades into the pericolonic adipose tissue.  One of 14 pericolonic lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma.  Ovary is negative.
2. Sigmoid colon tissue was positive for grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Tumor invades into the pericolonic adipose tissue.  Negative margins.  No lymph nodes removed from this region.
3. April 17, 2008, Dr. Montana performed an en bloc resection of the persistent psoas muscle mass as well as a portion of the small-bowel.  Pathology positive for grade 3 (of 4) colonic adenocarcinoma.  All visible disease removed.
4. June 6, 2008, through October 6, 2008, treated with FOLFOX plus Avastin therapy at her local facility.  Avastin was withheld until July at which time this was added.  Did require dose modification due to myelosuppression.
5. October 16, 2008, PET CT noting PET-positive soft-tissue within the left abdomen, most prominent near the sutures of the anastomosis of the colon.  This was worrisome for local recurrent disease.  Scattered increased activity throughout the residual left-side of the colon, rectosigmoid colon and small-bowel.  Majority appeared to be physiological activity.  CEA was increasing.
6. October 20, 2008, through December 10, 2008, FOLFIRI plus Erbitux therapy was administered.  Was treated with four treatments.
7. December 16, 2008, PET CT noting no evidence of new distant metastatic disease.  Moderate reduction in the focal uptake at the ileocolonic anastomosis.
8. January 5, 2009, colonoscopy noting ileotransverse anastomosis with mild stenosis as well as anastomosis at the rectosigmoid area.  Polyp removed from the sigmoid area positive for hyperplastic polyp.
9. January 6, 2009, Dr. Montana performed exploratory laparotomy as well as resection of the ileocolonic anastomosis.  Pathology for the anastomosis excision is negative for malignancy.
10. February 24, 2009, PET CT noting increased uptake at the ileocolonic anastomosis, which is most likely postoperative.
11. May 4, 2009, August 4, 2009, November 3, 2009, CT test negative for disease recurrence.
12. May 3, 2010, CT abdomen and pelvis noting indeterminate soft-tissue thickening in the anterior abdominal wall.  This is more prominent than it appeared on prior studies.  A second similar-appearing area of soft-tissue thickening slightly lower on the right anterior abdominal wall musculature.
13. May 4, 2010, ultrasound-guided biopsy of the abdominal wall mass is positive for malignancy, adenocarcinoma.
Mrs. Webb has been seen to discuss potential surgical resection of the newly developed lesions due to the fact that they are causing her discomfort.  She has been seen in followup to review the results of her PET CT.  Her PET scan showed three areas of high uptake.
Dr Montana did a endoscopy on her and there was an area of concern in the sigmoid colon that biopsied.
Mrs. Webb will undergo surgery today.
