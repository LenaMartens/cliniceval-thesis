[end section id="20100"]

[start section id="20112"]

DATA
Local lab work from December 17, 2009:  Her hemoglobin was 11.0, WBC 4.4, hematocrit 33.7, glucose 132, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8, ALT 21, AST 22, total bilirubin 0.6, calcium 9.1, total protein low at 6.1 but normal albumin at 4.0.   Other studies revealing normal B12 and vitamin B6, low iron saturation at 10%, normal total binding at 379, and normal total iron at 37.
Outside EKG from October 27, 2007, revealing sinus rhythm, rate 53, with a borderline first-degree AV block.
Outside x-ray report from October 2007 revealing normal PA and lateral chest with no cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION/PLAN
#1 Rectal cancer
Discussed staging with Pastor Conatser including a CEA, EUS, chest x-ray, and we will have her outside CT reviewed.  With her indeterminate liver lesions and due to her history of gastric bypass and the fact that she is more prone to cholelithiasis, I have tentatively scheduled an abdominal ultrasound to look at the liver and her gallbladder as if she needs surgery for rectal cancer, possibly her gallbladder may need to be removed if she has stones.  I will see her back with Dr. Ashley Snyder following her evaluation. Discussed possible need for neoadjuvant therapy. Briefly discussed ultralow anterior resection, coloanal, and APR with possibility for colostomy or temporary ileostomy. Will set-up stoma appointment after consultation with Dr. Snyder. Also discussed small possibility this is an early-stage tumor and sometimes we can go through the anus to remove the tumor.
#2 Steatohepatitis
We will start with baseline liver function tests.   We will get updated LFTs.  I do not suspect this should be a significant issue.
#3 Rheumatoid arthritis
Stable.
#4 Sjogren's syndrome
She requests eye exam.  We will put in an appointment and get this arranged if possible.
#5 Dysuria
We will obtain a urinalysis to rule-out a UTI, but we will hold off on  further bladder evaluation unless she has an abnormal UA.
#6 Osteopenia
Currently not on any treatment.  This is a lower priority for her at this time but should be addressed in the future by her primary.
#7 Hypertriglyceridemia
She has decided to go off her Crestor until her cancer has been addressed, and then her primary can likely check her cholesterol levels to see if it is still necessary for her to be on medication.
#8 Chronic insomnia
I discussed with her I would be willing to write her a prescription for Ambien CR to see if this works as she has been having trouble waking up in the middle of the night.  I think the Ambien CR will help.  She can start on the 6.25 mg and take up to 12.5 if needed.  I gave her 20 to try without refills.
#9 Status-post gastric bypass
As discussed above, will need to consider if she has cholelithiasis possible a cholecystectomy would be appropriate if she would need an abdominal operation for her rectal cancer.  We would have one of our general surgeons perform this and be consulted if this is indicated.
#10 Rhinorrhea
I do not see signs of acute infection.  We can proceed with her standard evaluation as scheduled.
#11 PAME
We will obtain chest x-ray, EKG, and basic blood work.  It sounds like she had a recent angiogram.  I do not think she needs an updated cardiac evaluation unless her EKG returns abnormal.
Spent 70 minutes with Pastor Conatser.  All questions were answered.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
Code status discussed.  She would like to be a full code.

Pastor Conatser is seen at the request of Dr. Newell for surgical evaluation for rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Pastor Conatser is a 63-year-old well-established female at CCHC but she has not been seen previously in the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery. She has a six-month history of an increase in the frequency of her stools to three-to-four times and a change in the caliber of her stools.  She also has had increased rectal bleeding. She has had intermittent rectal bleeding for many years and underwent a barium enema and likely a flexible sigmoidoscopy at Pine River Family Health Care approximately ten years ago that she informs me was normal.  That had been her only colon screening until recently. Due to changes in her bowel habits, she went to see her local primary-care provider, Dr. Long, who arranged a colonoscopy which she had on January 12.  This was completed to the terminal ileum.  She had a 3-cm rectal mass noted 6-cm from the anal verge which was biopsied, and we have confirmed this is an invasive grade 2 of 3 adenocarcinoma.  There were no other polyps or findings.  She has no family history of colorectal cancer or other malignancies.  She underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen/pelvis on January 12, and we will be having the images reviewed here.  Per local report, a 2.7- x 1.5-cm rectal mass was seen and there was pelvic lymph nodes seen measuring 4 to 6-mm. She had indeterminate low-attenuation lesions in the liver with one of these measuring 1 x 1.8-cm in the left lobe and a 1.2-cm in the dome of the left lobe also. She has a few scattered low-attention lesions in the kidneys also. She has a known history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was evaluated here with a liver biopsy due to problems with elevated LFTs in October 2003 which revealed mild-to-moderate steatosis with grade I steatohepatitis and stage I fibrosis. She has been more fatigued, but is unsure of whether this is related to her new cancer or due to her chronic rheumatoid arthritis.  She has not had a blood transfusion.  She denies fecal incontinence.  She has had intermittent abdominal symptoms for the last three-months with intermittent cramping in the right lower quadrant and epigastric discomfort that is not typical heartburn pain.  This has not been significant for her in that she has not taken pain medication but she has been noticing it more frequently, and it does not seem to be related to eating.  She underwent gastric bypass surgery locally in 2005.  She is unsure if this was a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, it was done laparoscopically, and her weight has come down significantly.  She has been stable around 140 pounds recently.  Occasionally she will have vomiting with certain foods which has been since her gastric bypass surgery, and this has not changed recently.
She has had long-standing symptoms of dysuria.  She brings up interstitial cystitis was mentioned in the past.  She has had problems with urinary tract infections also.  She denies hematuria.  No family history of bladder cancer. She was a smoker for 20 years, has a 20-pack-year history, and quit in 1985.  I do not see that she has had urological evaluation here, but in discussing the situation with her she does not necessarily want an evaluation as this has been chronic and has not changed.  She just wants to make sure she does not have an acute infection.  She feels she is emptying her bladder, and says she had a bladder scan which showed she was emptying previously.
While she is here at BCH she requests to undergo ophthalmic exam for her Sjogren's syndrome, history of cataracts, and since it has been a year since she has had her vision checked.  She is using over-the-counter drops (two drops twice-a-day) for hydration, with good results.  She does wear corrective lenses.
She also mentions she has not been sleeping well for many years.  She has been on zolpidem 10-mg chronically, but this has not been working for her recently.  She will be able to fall asleep, but she will not be able to stay asleep.  She has had a little rougher time with her new diagnosis recently and is wondering if adjustments can be made.  In reviewing her records here in 2003, she had a polysomnogram which revealed mild sleep apnea.  She was prescribed nasal CPAP at that time but did not return her follow-up appointment.  It was also mentioned Sonata did not work for her at that time.  They also diagnosed her with psychophysiologic insomnia.  She is not currently using CPAP, and this was before her gastric bypass surgery and she has had significant weight-loss since that time.   She does not feel she needs to meet with a counselor right now due to coping with her diagnosis and denies depression.  She reports that this has just been difficult as there was no family history of cancer.  She had never had polyps, so this was quite a surprise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Rectal cancer.  Discussed above.
2.  Rheumatoid arthritis.  She was tried on methotrexate for many years and then started developing the elevated LFTs and had an evaluation in 2000, and again in 2002 regarding her liver.  Discussed above.  Currently this is stable on her Plaquenil.  She has associated Sjogren's syndrome and Felty's syndrome.
3.  Steatohepatitis.  Diagnosed here with liver biopsy in 2003.
4.  Osteopenia.  A DEXA scan which she brings from September 2009 reveals evidence of osteopenia.  It was recommended she continue calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax.  She has Fosamax but does not really take this regularly and since her new diagnosis has gone off what she considers to be unnecessary medications including her calcium and vitamin D.
5.  Hypertriglyceridemia.  In reviewing her notes she had problems with her triglycerides.  Previously she had been on Crestor but stopped this a couple weeks ago after her diagnosis.  She believes since she has had significant weight-loss after her gastric bypass that likely her cholesterol has improved, and she does not feel she really wants to take this at this time.
6.  Heart murmur.  Discussed above.
7.  Chronic insomnia.  Discussed above.
8.  Prior history of diabetes mellitus type-2.  Since she has had significant weight-loss from her gastric bypass surgery, and informs me she is no longer diabetic although she brings records showing a recent fasting glucose of 132 likely revealing impaired glucose tolerance, possibly diabetes although she informs me she does not have diabetes.  She believes her hemoglobin A1c has been around 6, and she has not been on medicine for quite awhile.
9.  Prior history of hypertension.  Prior to her gastric bypass, she had been on medication for hypertension.  This has been stable and well-controlled without medication since she lost weight.
10. Hormone-replacement therapy (HRT).  She was recently on Premarin which she informs me was to help with her rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, but again with her recent rectal cancer diagnosis, she decided to go off this without ill-effects.
11. Squamous cell carcinoma.  She had a lesion removed on the right cheek of her face seven to eight years ago.
12.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  Discussed above.  Question of interstitial cystitis.
13.  History of multiple episodes of pneumonia and bronchitis when she was quite young.  She has had the Pneumovax since that time.
14.  History of sleep apnea.  Discussed above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Tonsillectomy
2.  C-section.
3.  Abdominal hysterectomy for benign reasons although she had what sounds to be a cyst that they thought was concerning for possible malignancy.
4.  History of sinus surgery.
5.  I & D of right neck abscess.
6.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the right cheek on her face removed approximately 2002.
7.  Gastric bypass surgery, unclear whether this was a Roux-en-Y, done laparoscopically in 2005 in Frontier.
