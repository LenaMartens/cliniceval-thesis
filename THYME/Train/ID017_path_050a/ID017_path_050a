Final Diagnosis
A. Colon, right, resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a mass (5.6 x 3.4 x 0.3 cm) located in the cecum, 1.6 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is identified.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 17) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. [AJCC pT3N1MX]

B.  Colon, sigmoid, polypectomy:  Polypoid inflamed colonic mucosa.

C.  Abdomen, herniorrhaphy:  Unremarkable fibromembranous tissue grossly consistent with hernia sac.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
