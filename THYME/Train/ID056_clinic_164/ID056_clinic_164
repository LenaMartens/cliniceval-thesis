#1 Ascending colon cancer, rule-out metastases
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. King, who also met with Mr. Duran.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient is scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, PET scan.  Outside readings of CT abdomen 17 June, MRI abdomen 23 June, MRI cardiac 23 June 2010 to be reviewed here.  I have also ordered medical oncology if needed.  Because of patient's arthritis, vague history of coronary artery disease, I would have him see cardiology with appropriate testing for OK-anesthesia.  I will see him back with the surgeon.
Spent 60 minutes with Mr. Duran discussing all of the above, answering all questions.

#1 Ascending colon cancer
Mr. Duran is a 55-year-old male who had what was an apparent gout attack in June.  Blood work showed him to be anemic (I do not have the hemoglobin) and he was placed on iron and then his local providers proceeded with colonoscopy on 16 June 2010 which showed a mass in the ascending colon which involved three-fourths of the circumference of the bowel wall.  The rest of colonoscopy was normal.  Pathology read here showed a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma arising from a tubulovillous adenoma.  In addition, Mr. Duran had an EGD which showed a submucosal antral nodule and multiple gastric polyps, otherwise normal endoscopy.  He then went on to have an upper endoscopic ultrasound, which indeed confirmed the antral submucosal lipoma.  CT-scan of the abdomen showed the known cecal mass within filtration of the pericolonic fat and clustered lymph nodes, metastatic disease versus fatty infiltration of the liver, and right pericardial masses, adenopathy to be excluded.  A submucosal lipoma in the body of the stomach was also seen.  MRI of the abdomen showed pathologic defect within the left lobe of the liver consistent with metastatic focus and also fatty liver seen.  Again, small lipoma within the wall of the stomach noted.  Cardiac MRI showed an enlarged epicardial lymph node, and a metastatic focus would have to be considered.  CT angiography from 2006 showed this node present but smaller.  Patient now comes to New Medico Rehabilition Medical Center for further evaluation of the above.  This was Mr. Duran's first colonoscopy.
