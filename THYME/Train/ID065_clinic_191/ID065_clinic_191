Mrs. Lynn is a pleasant 76 year-old female from New York, Dexter with ascending colon cancer who is admitted to the hospital for pre-operative blood transfusion and right hemicolectomy scheduled for Tuesday, August 10th.
Mrs. Lynn was evaluated by our colleagues in Orthopedics for right hip pain on June 29th, 2010 and in the process of assessing her appropriateness for a surgical intervention she mentioned her recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and colon cancer. She was referred to our service for further evaluation of colon cancer and initially seen by the Colon and Rectal Surgery division on June 29th, 2010.  She underwent colonoscopy on June 23rd at Lutheran Retirement Center which noted a mass near the hepatic flexure. CT abdomen and pelvis from July 7th, 2010 shows no evidence of distant metastasis. During the workup she was found to be anemic and will require a blood transfusion pre-operatively.
She and Mr. Lynn have met at length with our colleagues in Gastroenterology regarding her liver cirrhosis (presumably related to years of alcohol use) and with all available data they have determined her 30-day post-operative mortality is 14%, and 7-day mortality is 3.5-4% with a MELD score of 10 (down from 13) and Childs class B after approximately one-month of medical optimization.
Currently she is resting comfortably in bed. She denies any pain or physical complaints but is nervous about the blood transfusion and surgery. I discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to the blood transfusion. Her questions were answered and she consents to the transfusions.
