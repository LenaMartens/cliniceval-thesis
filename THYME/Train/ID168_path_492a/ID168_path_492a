Final Diagnosis
A.	Kidney, left, nephrectomy:  Grade 3 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, forms a 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.3 cm mass located in the upper pole.  The tumor is confined to the kidney.  The renal vein is grossly free of tumor.  The tumor does not involve the collecting system.  Coagulative tumor necrosis is absent.  Sarcomatoid differentiation is absent.  No renal hilar lymph nodes are identified.  The adrenal gland is absent.  The surgical margins are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT1bNX] (7th edition, 2010). 

B.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Microscopic foci of residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with marked treatment effect is identified arising in an ulcer (4.2 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm) located in the rectum, 5.2 cm from the distal margin.  Viable adenocarcinoma is present in muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 21) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with treatment effect.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N1] (7th edition, 2010).

C.  Colon, proximal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

D.  Rectum, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled left kidney is a left 495 gram, 11.0 x 7.5 x 5.2 cm kidney with a 11.0 cm of attached ureter and without adrenal gland.  There is a yellow solid 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.3 cm mass located in the upper pole.  The mass does not involve the sinus fat, collecting system, capsule or perirenal fat.  The renal vein is grossly uninvolved.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by HADDEN.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum, sigmoid"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 21.3 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  The radial margin is inked.  A 4.2 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm ulcerated mass is present within the rectum, 5.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 2.6 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HADDEN.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal colon ring"" is a 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm annular fragment of red tan erythematous bowel mucosa.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by HADDEN.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal ring"" is a 2.5 x 1.9 x 1.0 cm annular fragment of grossly unremarkable bowel mucosa.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by HADDEN.
