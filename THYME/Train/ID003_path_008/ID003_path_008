Final Diagnosis
A.  Vagina, apex, biopsy:  Benign squamous mucosa with chronic inflammation, negative for tumor.

B.  Vagina, left apex, biopsy:  Benign squamous mucosa with chronic inflammation, negative for tumor.

C.  Vagina, right apex, biopsy:  Benign squamous mucosa with chronic inflammation, negative for tumor.

D.  Rectum, perirectal, biopsy No.1:  Benign fibroadipose tissue.  Negative for tumor. 

E.  Vagina, right para mass, biopsy:  Recurrent moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with FIGO grade II (of III) endometrioid adenocarcinoma forming a 2.8 x 2.7 cm mass.

F.  Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (16) right pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
