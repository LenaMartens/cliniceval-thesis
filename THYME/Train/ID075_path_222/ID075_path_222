Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, extended right hemicolectomy:  Multiple (2) invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinomas are identified in the ascending colon (tumor No. 1) and transverse colon (tumor No. 2).  Tumor No. 1 forms 5.8 x 4.3 x 1.6 cm mass located 5.5 cm from the ileocecal valve and invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Tumor No. 2 forms a 6.2 x 4.5 x 2.2 cm mass located 5.3 cm from the distal resection margin and invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  There are multiple (2) hyperplastic polyps (0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm cecum; 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm transverse colon).  The appendix shows a sessile serrated adenoma and a microscopic (0.3 cm) gastrointestinal stromal tumor, without mitotic activity.  The proximal ileal and distal colonic margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (2 of 12) distal regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. Multiple (27) proximal regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. 

With available surgical material, [AJCCpT3N1MX]. 

Seen in consultation with Dr. Ashley J. Simpkins.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""Right colon"" is an extended right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 32.5 cm of terminal ileum, 37.3 cm of cecum, ascending and transverse colon, and a 9.3 x 0.8 cm appendix.  There are multiple (2) polypoid, mucinous masses (No. 1, 5.8 x 4.3 x 1.6 cm located 5.5 cm from the ileocecal valve; No. 2, 6.2 x 4.5 x 2.2 cm located 5.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin) in the colon.  There are also multiple (2) polyps (cecum, 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm; transverse colon, 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm) identified.  Multiple (26 proximal; 12 distal) regional lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LEANOS. 



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, extended right hemicolectomy: Two invasive carcinomas.  Two lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  HOLD to assess permanent sections of the remainder of the colon and appendix.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Ashley J. Garzon, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
Immunohistochemical stains (S100, smooth muscle actin, epithelial membrane antigen, KIT) were performed on the paraffin embedded appendiceal tissue.  The spindle cells are strongly positive for KIT and lack staining S100, smooth muscle actin and epithelial membrane antigen supporting the above diagnosis.
