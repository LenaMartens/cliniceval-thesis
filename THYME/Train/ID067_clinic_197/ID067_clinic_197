This is Mr.Lewis.  He is a 57-year-old gentleman referred by Fernanda Dalrymple with cecal carcinoma.  Mr. Lewis recently underwent colonoscopy and a cecal carcinoma was biopsy-proven.  He also had a rectal polyp which was apparently adequately removed and showed dysplasia.  In addition he has a very large liver lesion which may be cystic in nature but could be neoplastic, and Dr. Anderson will see him for this on Monday.
