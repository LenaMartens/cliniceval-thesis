#1 History of resected rectal carcinoma with 4 of 21 nodes positive
#2 DVT on anticoagulation
Plan:  I discussed the concept of adjuvant treatment with her.  I explained she could be cured with no additional treatment or even if she took chemotherapy she could still develop a recurrence of her cancer.  In terms of neoadjuvant treatment, she did not tolerate Xeloda, though she was receiving radiation therapy along with this.  She is on Coumadin and restarting Xeloda would create another problem from that standpoint.  As she is on anticoagulation, I am reluctant to put in a Port-A-Cath and consider FOLFOX therapy for her.  Given the choice of whether to take chemotherapy or not, she clearly wants to take it.  I would, therefore, suggest she take the weekly 5-FU, Leucovorin Jackson Regimen for six-months.  Since she lives near Mayville, it would be reasonable for her to receive her treatment there.  I have called the office of Dr. Ernie Hubbard to set-up an appointment for her to be seen by him.  The patient had signed a release for us to send him information.  Hopefully, she will tolerate this treatment without difficulty.  She may wish to return here for follow-up exams or on the other hand she may ultimately decide to continue care in Mayville.  She will let me know later what her wishes are.
We will send a copy of our CT-scan to Dr. Hubbard as a baseline study.

PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  2009--onset of hematochezia.  It worsened in November 2009.  She also had a 20- to 25-pound weight-loss which she attributes primarily to her decreased mobility from sciatica.
2.  January 29, 2010, colonoscopy revealed ulcerated mass in the midrectum.  Also noted was a 5-cm villous neoplasm just inside the dentate.  Pathology from the midrectum showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and biopsies from the distal rectum also showed tubulovillous adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous adenocarcinoma.  Staging scan showed no evidence of distant spread.  Her CEA was elevated to 36.5.
3.  February 2010--she began neoadjuvant radiation therapy with Xeloda.  She did not tolerate the treatment well.  She became dehydrated, developed bloody diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and a DVT.  She was hospitalized, and treatment was stopped.
4.  March 2010 while at-home had a left popliteal thrombus and was put on anticoagulation.
5.  May 7, 2010, APR with resection of the primary rectal carcinoma. Four of twenty-one nodes were positive for metastatic disease.
She is making good headway recovering from her surgery.  She has an appointment with Thrombophilia Clinic later today.  She has noted no lumps or bumps other than a hematoma that formed on her arm while blood pressure was being checked today.  Overall, she is feeling well.
