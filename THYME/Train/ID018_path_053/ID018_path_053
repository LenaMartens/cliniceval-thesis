Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma forming an 8.0 x 6.9 x 4.3 cm polypoid mass in the cecum.  Tumor directly invades through the serosa into muscularis propria of adjacent  ileum.  Lymphatic invasion is focally present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Appendix is unremarkable.  Multiple (2 of 24) regional lymph nodes are positive for neuroendocrine carcinoma.  Tumor is identified within the lumen of a vein in the mesentery.  

B.  Abdominal wall, excision:  Involved by neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Immunohistochemical stains performed demonstrate strong expression of chromogranin and synaptophysin and are negative for CDX-2, supporting the diagnosis.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A. Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 75.0 cm of terminal ileum, 25.0 cm of colon, and a 7.0 x 1.2 cm appendix.  An 8.0 x 6.9 x 4.3 cm polypoid mass is present within the cecum, 3.6 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends through the muscularis and forms an adhesion to a portion of small bowel.  The mass is 21.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BIRKHOLZ.

B.  Received fresh labeled abdominal wall - tumor extension is a 7.3 x 7.1 x 1.8 cm aggregate of yellow-red fibroadipose tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by ROGAN.
