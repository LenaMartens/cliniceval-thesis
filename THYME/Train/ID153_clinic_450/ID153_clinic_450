ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, not on file at BH.
Code status discussion:  Discussed code status with Mr. Gore.  I initially discussed this with Mr. Gore with his wife in the waiting room.  He informs me initially he wants to be a DNR.  I discussed with him that he does not have a terminal illness with his colon cancer at this time that we are aware of, and our goal is definitive treatment.  He does not have other chronic health problems that are life-threatening.  I told him in general people who chose to be a DNR usually have a terminal illness.  He says he understands that, but he states  "when it is my time, it is my time."  I then brought his wife in for discussion.  She did not appear to know about his wishes.  She felt that he should be a full code.  I did give Mr. Gore the sheet to review about the DNR status and what this means.  I also discussed with him that this means if his heart would stop later today in the clinic or he would stop-breathing that we would not do CPR and we would not insert a breathing tube.  He verbalized understanding and read through the DNR form.  He was given advance directives information.  I discussed with him that usually we need to change his status to a full code during the time of surgery and in the immediate postoperative period due to the likelihood that if something happens it is likely due to a treatable cause such as fluid shifts/electrolyte imbalances.  He can discuss this with Dr. Gomez tomorrow.  After a 25-minute discussion, Mr. Gore says he understands the DNR status.  He does not have any questions.  He still wants to be a DNR and this is his decision.  His wife does not appear to agree, but I informed him it is my job is to support his wishes.  He and his wife are working on completing an advance directive.  I explained to him that DNR status is different than him being a full code and then something happens such as he in is in a coma or a persistent vegetative state and a decision may be made to remove life support which would be a power of attorney decision.  That is a whole different situation than a DNR status.  He verbalized understanding.  I feel he is competent to make this decision.  I do not feel he is depressed or suicidal at this time.   I discussed with Mr. Gore that he can change his mind at any time, and he can remove the bracelet.
#1 Sigmoid colon cancer
Discussed we will get a liver ultrasound to evaluate the indeterminate area in the liver.  We will get an updated CEA here and a chest x-ray.  Likely he will need a sigmoid resection or low-anterior resection since it is in the low sigmoid.  Dr. Gomez can perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy to verify the location tomorrow.  I have asked him to prep with two enemas.  I do not feel we need to repeat the colonoscopy.  I will scan in his full colonoscopy and pathology report.  We had discussed when his wife was diagnosed with colon cancer that his son should undergo screening colonoscopy at age 44, and this is still an appropriate recommendation.
#2 Mild hyperlipidemia
Currently not on treatment.
#3 Obesity
#4 Code status discussion
DNR at this time.
#5 PAME
We will get an EKG and other blood work.  As he had a stress test a little over a year ago likely will not need to repeat one.  We will wait for his EKG.
#6 Tobacco abuse
Chewing tobacco cessation performed.  He is willing to meet with our Pauahi Wing Queens Hospital.
#7 Alcohol use
Discussed with him I would like him to decrease this to just one-a-day over the next few days.  He has not had problems in the past stopping completely.  I would not want him to go through withdrawal symptoms, but he does not think this should be a problem.
Spent 70 minutes with Mr. Gore and his wife reviewing the plan of care.  Will discuss with Dr. Gomez regarding Mr. Gore's wishes to be an DNR so this can be re-discussed tomorrow.  Dr. Gomez is in the OR today.

Mr. Gore is a 57-year-old male from Toledo, Ohio.  Interestingly, I evaluated his wife, Mrs. Tracy R. Gore, recently for rectal cancer.  She underwent a coloanal anastomosis in December 2009 with a diverting loop ileostomy and approximately a month ago returned for ileostomy closure by Dr. Jesse Gomez.  She is doing well.  With his wife's recent rectal cancer and as he had not undergone colonoscopy screening, he went in for a colonoscopy on April 12, 2010, and was found to have a 50% circumferential lesion at 16 cm. This was tattooed.  Biopsies were performed and reviewed here consistent with invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  The biopsy specimen says it was located at 18 cm but the colonoscopy report says 16 cm.  A local CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated April 12, 2010, has been reviewed revealing thickening and inflammation of the distal sigmoid colon consistent with his malignancy without lymphadenopathy.  He had a 6-mm low-density lesion in the right hepatic lobe that is indeterminate.  A local CEA on April 12, 2010, was 2.8.
Mr. Gore has noticed for the last six-months that his bowels have been a little bit on the looser side.  He moves them three times a day in the morning, and this has been stable for him.  He denies fecal incontinence.  No abdominal or rectal pain.  His weight has been stable.  He has been more fatigued for about the last 16 months and initially went in for evaluation of fatigue in January 2009 to his local provider.  He had a treadmill test which was normal.  He has no family history of colorectal cancer.  He had not had rectal bleeding until today. For the first-time he noticed bright-red hematochezia.  A CBC at-home was normal.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Sigmoid colon cancer.  Discussed above.
2.  Mild hyperlipidemia.  He was started on a statin, his wife believes this was likely Lipitor, but developed myalgias within a week and stopped it.  He has not tried other medications.  He believes his cholesterol was just mildly elevated.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Sleep disorder.  He can easily fall asleep but wakes up around 3 and has trouble going back to sleep and he feels tired.  This has been going on a long-time.  He does not wake-up because of the need to urinate.  He does not feel like this is related to anxiety. He is not taking any medication, and this has been a long-standing issue.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  Vasectomy.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Right inguinal hernia repair with likely mesh placement approximately 30 years ago although this is not noted on his CT-scan.
