Had a chance to discuss the stage of disease and potential adjuvant treatment options with Mr. Ammerman.  With the preoperative diagnosis of enlarged lymph nodes per MRI, we have to assume that these lymph nodes were actually tumor involved, so that we were facing a stage III scenario.  The patient had responded very well to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with resolution of the enlarged lymph nodes, which were now not tumor involved anymore by pathology.  In fact, only microscopic primary tumor was seen after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.
In this situation, I would strongly recommend using adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX as chemotherapy regimen.  I would recommend at least eight, if not 12 cycles of therapy, given the patient's young age.  The patient was very well oriented about these considerations and from his own perspective, already brought up the name FOLFOX.  He will return to Decatur, to continue his treatment with his local oncologist.  I would recommend obtaining a CT-scan before initiation of adjuvant therapy, to form a new baseline for future comparison.
The patient was content with the information he received.  All questions were answered.

Rectal cancer, presumably stage III, status-post neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and now surgical resection.

Mr. Ammerman is a very pleasant 44-year-old patient from Jackson, who was diagnosed in November 2009 with a rectal cancer, with a bulky tumor at 10-cm from the anal verge.  PET CT-scan revealed no evidence for metastatic disease.  An MRI identified several small lymph nodes in the perirectal area, so that the patient was classified as a stage IIIB tumor.  He received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with a NSABP R04 protocol, with infusional 5-FU with radiation sensitizer.  He came to Pinehurst County Clinic for further workup and therapy and was initially seen in Gastroenterology by Rita Dotson, RN, CNP.  On February 22, 2010, a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed resolution of the previously enlarged perirectal node, after new adjuvant radiochemotherapy.  No evidence of metastatic disease was found.  Dr. Dixon took the patient to surgery on February 25, 2010, for low-anterior resection with protective ileostomy.  Pathology confirmed the presence of a residual microscopic focus of a moderately differentiated grade III/IV adenocarcinoma.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis proper into the pericolonic set as a T3 lesion.  Then, 17 regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor involvement.  Testing for HNPCC is pending.
I am seeing Mr. Ammerman now to discuss potential adjuvant treatment options.  Upon visit, Mr. Ammerman was resting comfortably in bed.  He complained about some mild postoperative abdominal pain but was in good spirits and very well oriented to his disease.
