Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, left, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma arising from a tubulovillous adenoma is identified forming an ulcerative, polypoid, mucinous, annular mass (6.4 x 5.5 x 2.3 cm) located in the left colon, 12.8 cm from the proximal surgical resection margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat (less than 0.1 cm from the anterior serosa).  Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Two (of 44) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma [AJCC pT3 N1 MX]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
