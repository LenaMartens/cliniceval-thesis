#1 Resected stage IIIB ascending colon carcinoma
Patient underwent right hemicolectomy on April 7, 2010, for a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon which extended focally into the visceral peritoneum making it a T4 lesion.  There were 3 of 13 metastatic regional lymph nodes.  There is no obvious metastatic disease, and the patient has a hemangioma in the liver.
I discussed with Mrs. Harpole my recommendation or systemic adjuvant chemotherapy with the modified FOLFOX6 regimen.  Patient will need a Port-A-Cath for this treatment, and I will arrange general surgery consultation.  The recommendation for 12 cycles of treatment was reviewed with chemotherapy given every two-weeks.  The patient does have some residual neuropathy from prior chemotherapy related to breast cancer.  Therefore, we will initiate treatment with oxaliplatin but carefully monitor her for worsening peripheral neuropathy and make modifications as-needed.  Other potential side-effects of treatment were reviewed with the patient and her husband.  We will plan to initiate chemotherapy this week.
#2 Advanced colonic adenomas
The patient's colonoscopy demonstrated adenomas of the ascending and sigmoid colon in addition to the right colonic carcinoma.  She had not had prior colonoscopy.  There were three polyps in the sigmoid colon measuring 8, 5, and 2-mm, and pathology demonstrated tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  I am recommending repeat colonoscopy in six-months for further evaluation of the polypectomy site.  There is no known family history of colorectal cancer in this patient's family.  The pathology report did indicate that the appendix was involved by a sessile serrated adenoma.  These can develop within the microsatellite instability pathway.  Accordingly, I will request the pathologist to test the primary colon carcinoma for DNA mismatch repair protein expression.  There is evidence that these tumors may just demonstrate resistance to 5-FU.
#3 History of stage IIIA breast cancer
Treatment details are as outlined above.  Patient has completed five years of Arimidex therapy.  She is followed by Dr. Cottman in Medical Oncology.
#4 Peripheral neuropathy, likely chemotherapy related
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at Baptist Medical Center.

Mrs. Warren is a 67-year-old woman from California North Dakota, who underwent right hemicolectomy on April 7, 2010, for a stage III adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon.  Pathologic examination demonstrated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal extension to the visceral peritoneum, and 3 of 13 metastatic regional lymph nodes.  The patient is now approximately four weeks status-post surgical resection and has recovered well.  She denies abdominal pain and is not taking pain medication.  Her bowels move daily, and there is no blood in the stool.  Of note, her colonoscopy done preoperatively was for iron-deficiency anemia, and she had not had prior colonoscopy.  This examination demonstrated a cecal mass in addition to adenomatous polyps of the ascending colon and sigmoid.  The report describes sigmoid polyps measuring 8-mm, 5-mm, and 2-mm, the larger polyps being removed by snare polypectomy, and the smaller being biopsied.  Pathology demonstrated fragments of tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and hyperplastic polyp; all of these were from the sigmoid colon.  The patient also has a history of stage IIIA breast cancer in left breast which was infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma positive for ER and PR but negative for HER-2.  She was treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy with Adriamycin, Cytoxan, and Taxol.  She had also completed five years of Arimidex therapy.  She if followed by Dr. Rodney Cottman in TMC.
Patient indicates that she has had some residual neuropathy following chemotherapy for breast cancer.  She reports numbness and tingling in her feet which has persisted, and she previously took Neurontin 300-mg t.i.d. without benefit.  She indicated it does not interfere with her ambulation.
