#1 Rectal cancer
I agree with Manny Battiste's well-outlined recommendations, assessment, and treatment plan.  Mr. Como will have an abdominal and pelvic MRI possibly on Monday.  At this point, they are going to see if this could be performed at-home and then will have it sent to us.  We will have the outside CT-scan from 22 of July reviewed here as well as the PET scan from April.  Mr. Como will see Dr. Frandsen on Monday and have a flex sig on Monday as well.  We also discussed that Dr. Frandsen of course will ultimately determine whether there will be role for IORT as well as the ability to maintain continuity.  We discussed also the possibility of Lynch syndrome, and they would like to proceed with immunostaining.  We have the block here, and they have agreed to have this performed.  Spent a great amount of time speaking with the family about this and the role that Lynch syndrome possibly could have on impacting surgery, and we discussed that sometimes a total proctocolectomy is recommended, but this case is more complicated given that Demery's already had radiation to that area.  We will see him back when he returns with Dr. Frandsen on Monday.

Mr. Como is a 19-year-old man who was having problems with abdominal pain, bleeding, weight-loss, and ultimately underwent a colonoscopy on April 1, 2010.  He had a tumor present, approximately 4-cm from the anal verge.  Biopsies on review here show that these were an adenocarcinoma.  He underwent a chemoradiation treatment and finished this on May 2010, and follow-up done on July 27, 2010, showed that there is an increase in the size of the mass and possibly some seminal vesicle involvement as well as a left iliac node involved.  He is here for recommendations about surgery.
