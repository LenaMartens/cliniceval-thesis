Mr. Knopp underwent a proctocolectomy, end ileostomy for a rectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis on March 12, 2010. Postoperative day one he experienced a facial dehiscence and was taken to the operating room for repair of the abdominal wall dehiscence. He has done well postoperatively and calls today with an update on his progress. He states he is doing well. His appetite has returned to normal. His ileostomy is functioning well. He is inquiring if he needs further chemotherapy. I have explained it is standard of care to receive postoperative chemotherapy in the situation where he received preoperative chemotherapy. He will follow-up with his medical oncologist in Edwards. He will keep us informed of his progress.
