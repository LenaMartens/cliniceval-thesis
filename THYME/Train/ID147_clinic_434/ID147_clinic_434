#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N2, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Jamie Bobby Webb.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Terry Serrano, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
Mrs. Smith does not plan on returning to the outpatient setting, therefore I will ask Dr. Serrano to visit with her for formal treatment recommendations prior to hospital dismissal.  Mrs. Smith notes if there are any problems or concerns that arise in the future, I am more than happy to help facilitate care but, at this point, I will not make follow-up appointments.
