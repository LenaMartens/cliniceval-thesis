#1 Rectosigmoid cancer
The patient apparently has undergone chemoradiation therapy for an upper rectal cancer.  Initially I most likely would not have recommended this lesion undergo chemoradiation therapy, but he has already completed that.  He would now be in the window for which we would consider normal surgery, but because of his cardiac issues, this needs to be treated first.  From my point of view, he would be an outstanding candidate for a laparoscopic or robotic hemicolectomy.  He most likely would need a temporary diverting ileostomy because of the radiation therapy.  I would like to get his pathology slides from his biopsies and have them interpreted here.  We will also contact his medical oncologist to get documentation of what he was treated with as well as his radiation oncologist, getting us information about his radiation therapy.  He would also need to be re-staged with abdominopelvic CT-scan prior to surgery.  I will have to defer the timing of surgery to our cardiovascular surgery colleagues about when they would do his valve in order to proceed with our surgery once he has recovered.  This was discussed with the patient.  We will gather the other information and plan on pursuing surgery at the appropriate time after Cardiovascular Surgery has cleared him to proceed with the next procedure.

Off-floor consult.
I was asked by Dr. Evans to see Mr. Waller in regard to his rectal cancer.

This is a 65-year-old gentleman from elsewhere who underwent a colonoscopy in the latter half of 2009 in the winter and was found to have a rectosigmoid cancer.  He underwent what sounds as if it was chemoradiation therapy (it certainly was chemotherapy) for a lesion that was at 12 to 15-cm.  He has now completed that therapy and was undergoing evaluation for preoperative clearance and was found to have severe aortic stenosis.  He was sent here for consideration of aortic valve replacement.  I was asked to consult on his colorectal cancer.  The review from our cardiology colleagues shows that he has severe disease and would need to have that taken care of before proceeding to surgery for his colorectal cancer.  The patient's history is notable for no prior or significant abdominal surgery other than an appendicitis.  He has completed his therapy five weeks ago and did well with it, only some diarrhea from the therapy.
