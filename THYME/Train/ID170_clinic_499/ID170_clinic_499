#1 Resected stage II colon adenocarcinoma (T3, N0, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Davis service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Rivera, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
We would like Mr. Locher to return in the outpatient setting for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  To this end, I have ordered a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis (without contrast), chest x-ray, comprehensive lab panel including a CEA, MSI testing, and an appointment with us in Medical Oncology as well as a postoperative evaluation with Dr. Roberts.  He verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.

I was asked by Dr. Davis service to visit with Mr. Locher for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Locher is a pleasant 70-year-old male from Missouri.  He has a prior past medical history significant for prostate cancer treated with a prostatectomy in 2002 (no chemotherapy or radiation), as well as chronic right-sided hydronephrosis due to chronic urinary obstruction with a baseline creatinine of 1.3, followed by Urology.
1.  May 7, 2010 - screening colonoscopy identified a 5-cm transverse colon polyp.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
2.  May 13, 2010 - Chest x-ray was negative.  CT-scan (without contrast) showed no evidence of distant metastasis.
3.  May 19, 2010 - Abdominal ultrasound (due to lack of contrast on CT-scan) showing an indeterminate 1.0-cm x 0.7-cm x 0.8-cm mass in the live.
4.  May 20, 2010 - MRI of the abdomen identified 7-mm and 4-mm hepatic lesions, questionable for focal nodular hyperplasia.
5.  May 20, 2010 - taken for resection of portion of transverse colon, wedge resection of portion of II and III of the liver, and intraoperative ultrasound by Drs. Roberts and Pat Sena.  Surgical pathology from the transverse colon resected showed grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.1-cm x 3.0-cm x 1.2-cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  The surgical margins were negative, and 30 lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  Liver, portion of Segments II and III, showed focal nodular hyperplasia forming a-1.4-cm x 1.1-cm x 0.9-cm mass.  There were negative margins.  This was staged at a T3, N0, M0.
Mr. Locher is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
