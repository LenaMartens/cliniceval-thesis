Final Diagnosis
A.  Ascending and transverse colon, resection:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming an 8.0 x 7.0 x 2.7 cm annular mass in the transverse colon, 2.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat and focally penetrates the visceral peritoneum.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  Multiple (2 of 13) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4aN1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""ascending and transverse colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 1.2 cm of terminal ileum, 39.0 cm of colon, and a 12.5 x 1.0 cm appendix.  An 8.0 x 7.0 x 2.7 cm annular mass is present within the transverse colon, 28.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 2.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PERRY.



Addendum Diagnosis
Given the morphology of the tumor as well as its location, immunohistochemistry was performed on the paraffin-embedded tumor sections using antibodies directed toward DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.  There is aberrant loss of MLH1 and PMS2 with intact expression of MSH2 and MSH6.  These findings confirm defective DNA mismatch repair due to loss of MLH1 expression with secondary loss of PMS2.  Differentiation between germline and somatic MLH1 abnormality will require mutation analysis.


Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jared Alaniz, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon tissue (block A2).  Upon completion, results will be available in MPXR NsusYnev.


Slide Disposition
12/17/10--6 molgen recuts to MG for k-ras at request of Dr. Jared Alaniz/smith
