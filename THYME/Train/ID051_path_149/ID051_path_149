Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon and anus, total abdominal colectomy:  Residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming scattered microscopic foci of viable tumor cells, associated with pools of mucin and fibrosis (consistent with moderate response to therapy), forming an ulcerated mass (2.2 x 1.9 x 0.4 cm), situated 11.0 cm from the dentate line.  The viable tumor cells infiltrate up to the submucosa but the pools of mucin extend into but not through the muscularis propria.  No angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The colon shows mildly active chronic ulcerative colitis involving the entire length of colon.  Grossly, there is continuous involvement from the rectum proximally and marked mucosal atrophy.  No skip areas are identified.  Microscopically, there is dense, predominantly mucosal inflammation, focal crypt abscesses, and diffuse thickening of the muscularis mucosa.  No granulomas are identified.  The colonic mucosa adjacent to the tumor bed show superimposed active inflammation, ulceration and reactive epithelial changes, consistent with treatment effect.  The terminal ileum shows active chronic ileitis, consistent with backwash ileitis.  The margins of resection are negative for tumor.   Multiple (29) lymph nodes are negative for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""colon and anus"" is a total abdominal colectomy specimen consisting of 3.5 cm in length portion of ileum, 130.0 cm in length colon.  Appendix is absent.  A 2.2 x 1.9 x 0.4 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, located 15.0 cm from the mucosal margin and distal, anal skin margin, and 5.0 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  The mucosa shows continuous involvement from the rectum proximally with marked mucosal atrophy extending up to the mid transverse colon (92.0 cm).  No skip areas are identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SHEPHERD.


Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon and anus, total abdominal colectomy:  No definite viable tumor cells are identified within pools of mucin, forming an ulcerated mass (2.2 x 1.9 x 0.4 cm).  The pools of mucin involve the submucosa and into but not through the muscularis propria. The colon shows active ulcerative colitis.  The margins of resection are negative for tumor (closest margin, 5.0 cm radial)  Hold over for permanent sections to assess tumor viability, activity of ulcerative colitis and lymph nodes.
