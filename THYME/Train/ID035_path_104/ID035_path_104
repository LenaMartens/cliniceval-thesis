Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a polypoid mass (4.5 x 3.4 x 1.6 cm), located 2.8 cm from the distal resection margin.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve the perirectal adipose tissue.  The uninvolved colon shows multiple (15) hyperplastic polyps (ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.5 cm).  The resection margins are negative for tumor (nearest tumor free margin, 0.5 cm, radial margin).  One (of 21) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma (0.5 cm in greatest dimension) with extranodal extension present.

With available surgical material, [AJCC pT3N1]

Seen in consultation with Dr. Jackie J. Rivera.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum and sigmoid colon"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 28.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon without portion of anus.  A 4.5 x 3.4 x 1.6 cm exophytic polypoid mass is present in the proximal rectum, 2.8 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 0.5 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.   The uninvolved colon shows multiple (15) hyperplastic polyps ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.5 cm.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by SAIZ.

A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resections:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a polypoid mass (4.5 x 3.4 x 1.6 cm), located 2.8 cm from the distal resection margin.  
The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve the perirectal adipose tissue.  The uninvolved colon shows multiple (15) hyperplastic polyps ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.5 cm.  The resection margins are negative for tumor (nearest tumor free margin, 0.5 cm, radial margin).  Hold over to assess lymph nodes on permanent sections.
