Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Reel Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Gabbard, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have reviewed with the patient the recommendations that her primary oncologist, Dr. Stewart, had previously outlined.  At this time, recommending that she proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy.  Recommending treatment that will last approximately four months' time.  Would treat her with FOLFOX chemotherapy.  She will be returning in approximately four weeks' time to be seen by her primary oncologist.  Appointments have already been arranged.  She denies any further questions or concerns.  She has our telephone number to contact us should she have any further questions or concerns.

Mrs. Smith is a pleasant 48-year-old woman from Michigan Florida.  She is an established patient of Dr. Robin Stewart's.  I am seeing her today at the request of Dr. Mccloskey to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma (pT3,N1).
Mrs. Smith's history is as follows:
1.  November 2009 patient was found to be anemic and treated on iron supplementation.
2.  December 2009 developed alternating constipation and diarrhea as well as bloating and gaseous discomfort.  Patient also noted a change in her stool caliber.
2.  March 3, 2010, colonoscopy identifies a rectal mass.  Biopsy confirmed invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Patient reviewed here at Pottstown.
3.  March 18, 2010, endoscopy with EUS at Pottstown.  Tumor identified at 7-cm from the anal verge, meeting T3 criteria per EUS.  Three peritumoral lymph nodes measuring 7-mm in maximum diameter identified, not amenable to FNA due to location.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis without evidence of metastases; Dr. Tomasini Colorectal Surgery recommends neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.
4.  April 5 through May 13, 2010 - Radiochemotherapy with capecitabine as radiosensitizer.  Overall tolerated well.
5.  June 22, 2010, Dr. Mccloskey performed an ultra low-anterior resection with descending colorectostomy.  Pathology from the resection is positive for residual invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Negative surgical margins.  Of 18 lymph nodes, 5 were positive for metastatic disease.  Also, noted multiple (2) tumor deposits in the pericolonic fat that represents discontinuous spread or venous invasion with extravascular spread.
Today, Mrs. Smith is three days postoperative.  She is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  I reviewed CVI and PFH dated March 16, 2010.
