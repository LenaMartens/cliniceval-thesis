Final Diagnosis
A.  Pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder, and transverse and right colon, en bloc resection:  Poorly grade 4 (of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 13.5 x 11.5 x 11.0 cm ulcerating mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and directly invades adjacent duodenum and focally the pancreas.  Angiolymphatic invasion is present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor, including the pancreatic margin and common bile duct margins.  Multiple (5 of 53) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  Gallbladder, histologically unremarkable.  Appendix histologically is uninvolved.  The grossly described nodule in the omentum shows metastatic adenocarcinoma, see comment.

B.  Soft tissue, tumor thrombus portal vein, biopsy:  Thrombus clot, negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N2M1] (7th edition, 2010).

Photograph taken.

Diagnosis Comment
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the colon using antibodies directed against the following antigens: CK20, CDX-2, CK7, TTF-1, WT-1, and ER.  The neoplastic cells are positive for CK20 and CDX-2 and negative for CK7, TTF-1, WT-1, and ER.  These findings support the above diagnosis.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh and labeled ""pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder and rt colon"" is an en bloc resection, consisting of a 27.0 cm portion of duodenum, 29.0 cm portion of terminal ileum, 37.0 cm portion of colon, a 7.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm diameter appendix, and a 4.4 x 3.6 x 3.3 cm portion of pancreas.  There is a 13.5 x 11.5 x 11.0 cm yellow-tan-green, soft necrotic mass with a lobulated cut surface, that grossly ulcerates the wall of the transverse colon and duodenum.  The mass abuts but does not grossly invade the pancreas.  The mass demonstrates a 6.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm area of central cavitation.  Within the omentum, there is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm tan-white nodule.  The mesentery reveals a tan-white, 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm nodule.  The 9.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm gallbladder is uninvolved by tumor.  The wall thickness is uniform (0.5 cm), the cystic duct is patent, and the mucosa demonstrates cholesterolosis.  A cystic duct lymph node is identified.  The uncinate, pancreatic head, common hepatic duct margins are taken en face and the portal vein groove is sampled perpendicularly.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified and submitted.  Grossed by HORTON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""tumor thrombus portal vein"" is a 4.2 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm portion of pink-tan tissue.  Photograph taken.  All submitted.  Grossed by COLLIER.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder, and rt colon, en bloc:  Moderately grade 3 (of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 13.5 x 11.5 x 11.0 cm ulcerating mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum directly invades other organs or structures.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor including the pancreatic margin and common bile duct margins.  Multiple (5 of 53) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  Gallbladder, histologically unremarkable.  Appendix, histologically is uninvolved.  The grossly described nodule in the omentum shows metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Soft tissue, tumor thrombus portal vein, biopsy:  Thrombus clot, negative for tumor.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Sandy Coomer, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Tracy Fisher, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon tissue (block A20).  Upon completion, results will be available in HHNL GtrhAvvf.
