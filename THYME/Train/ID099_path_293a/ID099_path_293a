Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, segmental resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative, nearly annular mass (5.0 x 4.9 x 2.2 cm) located in the rectum, 3.4 cm from the distal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is focally suspicious.  The tumor extends to within 0.9 cm of the radial resection margin.  Multiple (6 of 36) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. [AJCC ypT3 N2a MX]

B.  Rectosigmoid, proximal margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid, rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 27.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon without anus.  A 5.0 x 4.9 x 2.2 cm ulcerative, nearly annular mass is present within the rectum, 3.4 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 0.9 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BELK.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal colonic margin"" is a 3.2 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm segment of colon tissue without gross abnormalities identified.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by GAULKE.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""distal rectal margin"" is a 1.7 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm segment of colonic mucosa and colon wall without gross abnormalities.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by GAULKE.


Internal Comments
2/2/10 - initially HNPCC (""reflexive"") ordered; WOODS spoke with BRANNON to insure there wasn't special request for it and there was not; because patient >50 y.o., we did not pursue reflexive (molgen cuts filed)/rjc
