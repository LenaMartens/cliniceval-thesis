Ms. Jean Murphy has had a three-year history of constipation, and initially this was thought to be secondary to analgesic medication which she was taking for back pain.  Use of laxatives did not improve her symptoms, and two years ago, she developed rectal bleeding which she describes as dark red blood mixed with the stool.  In April 2010, she had the colonoscopy which essentially showed a mass in the rectum which was biopsy-proven as adenocarcinoma.  She had a PET CT-scan performed on April 9, 2010, which showed disease within the rectum and pelvis with an 8-mm left iliac node.  She was given a staging of T4 N1 M0.  On April 13, 2010, due to the near-obstructing lesion in her rectum, a sigmoid loop diverting colostomy was performed in addition to an EUS and also an examination under anesthesia that was performed which demonstrated a nodular lesion in the rectum penetrating the anal canal and also nodularities in the posterior vaginal wall.  A left subclavian Port-a-Cath was also inserted.  She was commenced on neoadjuvant therapy with radiation and 5-FU as a radiosensitizer in May 2010 and completed 6 cycles.  She comes now for surgical management of this rectal cancer.
