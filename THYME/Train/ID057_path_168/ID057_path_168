Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 4.3 x 4.0 x 0.8 cm ulcerated polypoid mass in the ascending colon located 4.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat. Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  A tubular adenoma (0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) is present in the cecum.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the tip.  Multiple (39) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
