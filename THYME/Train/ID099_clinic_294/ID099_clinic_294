#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N2 [6 of 36], M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Sabo service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Calderon, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.  As previously indicated by Dr. Chandler preoperatively, we would continue to recommend four to six-months of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Mr. Jarvis certainly can receive this locally in Gardendale, and he does not plan on returning in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation.  I have emphasized that he needs to be evaluated in four weeks by a local medical oncologist and have gone over the logistics and side-effects with respect to FOLFOX, and he verbalized understanding.  I will not make followup appointments for Mr. Jarvis at this point, but I have emphasized to him and his family that certainly if the need arises in the future we would be more than happy to help facilitate care.

Supervised by: Taylor Calderon, M.D. (465-5107).
Resected lymph node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N2 [6 of 36], M0).

I was asked by Dr. Horton's service to visit with Mr. Jarvis for postoperative education purposes.
Briefly, Mr. Jarvis is a very pleasant 51-year-old male from Gardendale.
1.  December 2009 - screening colonoscopy noted a circumferential rectal mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  CT-scan was negative for distant metastasis.
2.  January 5, 2010 - CT enterography was performed at the Clinic and showed a circumferential ulcerated mass 5-cm long at the junction of the rectum and sigmoid.  EUS again demonstrated the rectal lesion.  This was thought to be a T3, N1 tumor with indeterminate peritumoral lymph nodes suggestive for metastatic disease.
3.  January 7, 2010 - see by Dr. Jamal Reed who recommended a short course of radiation with no concurrent chemotherapy.  He was also evaluated by Dr. Louis Chandler of Medical Oncology who concurred with the recommendation for a short course of radiation and then followup with four to six-months of adjuvant FOLFOX.  Patient was also seen by Dr. Horton who concurred with the overall recommendation.
4.  January 25 through January 29, 2010 - underwent external-beam radiation without chemotherapy for a total of 25 cGy of radiation.  This was overall tolerated well.
5.  February 1, 2010 - underwent laparoscopic coloanal resection by Dr. Horton and diverting loop ileostomy.  Surgical pathology noted invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerative, nearly annular 5.0-cm x 4.9-cm x 2.2-cm mass in the rectum.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria and extended to within 0.9-cm of the radial resection margin, and 6 of 36 regional lymph nodes were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  This was staged at a T3, N2, M0 resected rectal adenocarcinoma.
Mr. Jarvis is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in a chair during our consultation today.
