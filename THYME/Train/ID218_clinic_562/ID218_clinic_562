This case was discussed and supervised by Dr. Calderon, and Si Ester, P.A.-C., was also present.
#1 Adenocarcinoma of the rectum involving the posterior vaginal wall
She has completed neoadjuvant radiation therapy with 5-FU as a radiosensitizer with her last dose on June 17, 2010.  Ms. Jean Murphy now needs to be evaluated for surgery, and this is in process with a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis being scheduled along with a consultation by Radiation Oncology to consider any role of intraoperative radiotherapy. The gynecologists are also being consulted for their help in the setting for surgical intervention on her vaginal wall involvement.
#2 Preoperative assessment
Ms. Jean Murphy is having a chest x-ray and ECG along with lab work prior to surgery.  Her performance status is currently 1, and if her labs and imaging and ECG come back within normal limits, she is clear for surgery.
#3 Nicotine dependence
We are referring Ms. Jean Murphy to our Nicotine Dependency Service to aid in this since this will be crucial to aid in healing postoperatively.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Ms. Murphy Murphy is a very pleasant 38-year-old Wvklpd-Hscudkou lady from Austin, who comes to the Clinic today accompanied by her mother.  She has had a three-year history of constipation, and initially this was thought to be secondary to analgesic medication which she was taking for back pain.  Use of laxatives did not improve her symptoms, and two years ago, she developed rectal bleeding which she describes as dark red blood mixed with the stool.  In April 2010, she had the colonoscopy which essentially showed a mass in the rectum which was biopsy-proven as adenocarcinoma.  She had a PET CT-scan performed on April 9, 2010, which showed disease within the rectum and pelvis with an 8-mm left iliac node.  She was given a staging of T4 N1 M0.  On April 13, 2010, due to the near-obstructing lesion in her rectum, a sigmoid loop diverting colostomy was performed in addition to an EUS and also an examination under anesthesia that was performed which demonstrated a nodular lesion in the rectum penetrating the anal canal and also nodularities in the posterior vaginal wall.  A left subclavian Port-a-Cath was also inserted.  She was commenced on neoadjuvant therapy with radiation and 5-FU as a radiosensitizer in May 2010 and completed 6 cycles.  Treatment was held on June 3 due to skin toxicity, but she states that her last radiation was on June 17.  Surgery was then planned, but there were some issues with her financial status, and so she has subsequently come to GCGH for further evaluation.
Over the last months, she has remained reasonably asymptomatic with no issues with her colostomy or considerable issues with pain.
Her comorbidities include having a previous cholecystectomy (exact reason unknown).  She had previous spine surgery for lumbar disk protrusion at the level of L3, L4.  She has a history of depression with alcohol dependence, but she states that she has not had an alcoholic drink for the last five to six-months.  She is a current smoker, having started smoking at the age of 13 and currently has a 25-year smoking history at one-pack-a-day.
She has three children at-home, a 5-year-old son, a 2-year-old son, and a 21-year-old daughter.  She is currently not working.
