#1 Stage III, T3, N1 colorectal cancer
I reviewed her pathology.  It looks like her pathology report is showing grade 3 out of 4 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 2.0- x 1.2- x 0.3-cm mass and a tumor invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  There were 3 out of 12 regional lymph nodes that were positive.  The uterus, ovary, and the fallopian tube are not involved by the tumor.  The margin was negative.  This was consistent with stage IIIB colorectal cancer.  I discussed with the patient and family our central approach will be giving adjuvant chemotherapy to stage III colorectal cancer in the format of FOLFOX.  This involves three-drug combination with 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin.  I went through the common side-effects associated with the three drugs.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Miller still has open wound, so I am a little concerned starting chemo in this setting.  The plan is to have her come back in one-to-two weeks, reassess her clinical status.  If her wound is healed by that time then we would potentially consider chemotherapy. However, if her wound is not totally recovered then we may have to forego the adjuvant chemotherapy.  All the questions were answered.  Patient expressed good understanding and satisfaction.

Ms. Miller is a very pleasant 78-year-old woman from Maidens San Saba, currently living in Fort Wayne coming here for a follow-up resected colorectal adenocarcinoma.
1.  October 2009-November 2009 - Hospitalized at several different times with diverticulitis with abscess.  During those hospitalizations, she did develop atrial fibrillation and required extensive cardiac workup.
2.  January 7, 2010 - Due to patient's continued abdominal pain, a colonoscopy was performed and 20 cm from the anal verge was noted to have an obstruction that was not passable.  There was no mass identified, however the mucosal changes suggested edematous lesion which was suspicious for stricture versus malignancy.  Biopsy of this area was positive for tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
3.  January 14, 2010 - Underwent hypaque enema which noted a marked area of irregularity in the midsigmoid colon.  There was a long fistulous tract from the segment of the sigmoid to the skin.
4.  January 19, 2010 - CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted marked wall thickening in the midsigmoid colon with colon perforation and colocutaneous fistula, suspicious for perforated colon cancer.  She was also noted to have an indeterminate 4-mm ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung.  Drain was placed into the fistula.
5.  February 1, 2010 - Repeat CT-scan documenting resolution of the fluid collection previously identified.  Persistent wall thickening and adjacent inflammatory changes in the pericolonic fat.  New was a 6.8 x 4.4 subcutaneous peripheral gas and fluid collection left of the umbilicus which was suspicious for a superficial abscess.  Also noted increased gas within the bladder.  This new area subsequently had a drain placed.
6.  February 8, 2010 - MRI pelvis noted diffuse thickening in the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum.  Complex air and fluid collections along the superior left margin of the uterus as well as along the right inferior margin.  These communications probably communicate.  The superior collection appears to communicate with a loop of thickened sigmoid colon.  This superior collection also abuts the superior margin of the bladder.  The bladder wall is diffusely thickened, more focally in the region adjacent to the fluid collection, and there is suggestion of a small fistulous tract extending toward the bladder.
7.  February 15, 2010 - Dr. Bertrand performed en-bloc resection of the colon, rectum, and uterus.  Once in to the abdominal cavity, there was evidence of stool within the cavity.  At this area, they could see where the colon had perforated.  Proximal to this area, they could palpate the mass.  Pathology of the tissue removed from the rectum, uterus, bilateral tubes, and ovaries is positive for moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a polypoid mass.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  Surgical resected margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Of 12 regional lymph nodes removed, three were positive for metastatic disease (pT3, N1).  Today, Mrs. Miller is four days postoperative.  She is alert and oriented.  Her two sons are available during this consultation as well.
8.  During the perioperative period she has had a complication of thrombocytopenia likely secondary to a different antibiotic used for pericolonic abscess treatment.  Also she has had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.  This has been controlled.
Mrs. Miller has been about five weeks after surgery as generally recovering.  She still has a couple of open wounds in her abdomen, and she is gaining more strength back at the nursing home.  She is mostly active during the day and takes a couple of naps so ECOG performance status is probably around 1 to 2 currently.  She denies fever, chills.  Denies significant pain.  She is eating well.  She is starting to gain some weight.  She lost about 30 pounds since last October, but now she is gradually gaining more weight.
