Seen on May 10 in conjunction with Dr. Kraft (765-404-02376).
Recurrent endometrial cancer.

In brief, I agree with the history and physical and recommendations as recorded on the chart by Dr. Jesse Kraft.  I have personally interviewed the patient and her family and briefly examined her.  She is recuperating uneventfully from this most recent surgery which resected a sidewall tumor compatible with endometrial cancer grade 2.  The patient's original diagnosis of endometrial cancer was five years ago and at that time was felt to be grade 1 and did not require adjuvant therapy.  At this time, the patient has no obvious evidence of disease outside the pelvis, and the strong consideration is for radiation as adjuvant or a few cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation.
The patient's personal history of multiple cancers is intriguing.  She certainly is a survivor of breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and now endometrial cancer.  Family history is also interesting for other family members with breast and colon cancer.  She is willing to follow-up with Medical Genetics when she returns for her postop appointments.  That would not influence how she is treated at this time, however.
We discussed the pros and cons and the current statistical evidence for the role of chemotherapy to prevent recurrence.  She is in a gray zone because of the biologic nature of her disease with a long disease-free interval suggesting minimal effect of possible adjuvant chemotherapy.  However, she is in an intermediate grade that now suggests that there may have been some cells that were more aggressive than others from the original tumor.
The patient has had a gastroenterology workup with an EGD showing atrophic gastritis.  She has been treated for H-pylori.  She has intermittent episodes of incontinence but mostly poorly formed stool.  She has had a negative colonoscopy with an excellent prep, and therefore, we do not believe that there are any obstructive lesions causing this symptomatology.  Follow-up with Gastroenterology will be important, however, for quality of life and for management if we should decide that the patient will receive radiation, chemotherapy, or both.  She is going to be meeting with Radiation Oncology hopefully before she leaves the hospital tomorrow.

General:  She was alert and appropriate and normal vital signs.  She was afebrile.  She did not require oxygen.Extremities:  Her extremities did show superficial varicosities of the left calf (by personal report, she had at least two episodes of superficial phlebitis in distant years).Abdomen:  Her clinical exam showed her abdomen healing well.
