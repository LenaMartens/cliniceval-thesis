Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, total abdominal colectomy:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.1 x 2.8 x 0.8 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon, located 24.3 cm from the distal surgical resection margin.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (greater than 150) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) are also present.  The appendix is unremarkable.  A single (1 of 61) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  

B.  Rectum, distal margin, excision:  An unremarkable 0.6 cm portion of rectum identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

With available surgical material [AJCCpT3N1]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""total abdominal colon and rectum"" is a total colectomy specimen including 4.2 cm of terminal ileum, 143.0 cm of cecum, colon, and rectum, and a 4.7 x 0.9 cm appendix.  There is a 3.1 x 2.8 x 0.8 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon, located 24.3 cm from the distal surgical resection margin, and 1.4 cm from the radial margin.  There are multiple (greater than 150) polyps (ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) throughout the colon but predominantly in the transverse colon through rectum.  Multiple (60) lymph nodes are identified in the mesentery of the distal portion of the specimen.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by RICHARDSON.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""rectal margin"" is a 0.6 cm unoriented portion of colon.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by RICHARDSON.
