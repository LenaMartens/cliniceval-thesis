Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an exophytic mass (3.0 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm) located in the rectum, 3.2 cm from the distal resection margin.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 2.2 cm of the radial resection margin.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4) tubular adenomas are identified in the rectum.  Multiple (49) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  [AJCC pT2N0MX]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
