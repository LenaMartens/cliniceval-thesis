#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma
Dr. Jenkins is a very pleasant 79 year-old male with metasynchronous resected colon cancer seeking treatment recommendations.
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Donna Fordyce's  Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Gladys Johnson, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Dr. Jenkins does not plan on following-up at Montana State Valley Hospital.  Furthermore, we are not recommending any adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting.  I have discussed with him the need for genetic consultation.  I will ask Dr. Johnson to visit with Dr. Jenkins prior to dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  Certainly, if the need arises in the future, we will be more than happy to help facilitate care.  Dr. Jenkins also notes he has a local medical oncologist in Mount Jewett Pennsylvania that he follows-up with routinely.

Dr. Jenkins is a very pleasant 79 year-old male who is a retired vrnhnmu gukgrta.  He has a prior past medical history significant for coronary artery disease (status-post coronary bypass grafting), atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia.
1.  2003 - Diagnosis of ascending colon cancer with multiple other polyps noted in the colon.  Underwent right hemicolectomy for a T3, N0, M0.  Colon adenocarcinoma (number of lymph nodes unavailable at time of dictation).  Given a bolus of 5FU plus leucovorin for three weeks, unable to complete scheduled chemotherapy regimen due to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight-loss, and rash.
2.  2003-2010 - CEAs, colonoscopies and imaging all negative for distant metastatic disease.
3.  September 2010 - Follow-up CEA up to 52.  Patient also complained of 20-pound weight-loss, fatigue, and decreased appetite.  CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of distant disease and unable to identify a mass in the colon.
4.  September 24, 2010 - Colonoscopy and EGD performed showing a mass at 70 cm in the colon.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
5.  October 1, 2010 - Referred to Montana State Valley Hospital.  Colonoscopy performed identifying a 2-cm lesion at the splenic flexure.  Biopsies confirmed tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  Other polyps noted.  CEA 75.6.  EGD positive for H-pylori.
6.  October 4, 2010 - PET CT-scan showing no evidence of distant disease but identified a mass 40 cm distal to the previous anastomosis.
7.  October 5, 2010 - MRI showing no evidence of distant disease but hepatic cysts.
8.  October 8, 2010 - Taken by Dr. Fordyce for a subtotal colectomy identifying a 3.1 x 3.2 x 0.8-cm mass in the descending colon invading through the muscularis propria, 14 regional lymph nodes negative for disease, negative surgical margins, no evidence of distant disease.  DNA mismatch repair performed on specimen confirming a variant loss of expression MLH1 and PMS2 confirming DNA mismatch repair due to loss of MHL1 expression with secondary loss of PMS2.
Dr. Jenkins is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation.
