#1 Adenocarcinoma of the colon
There are two masses that have been biopsy-proven as adenocarcinoma from the outside hospital.  The first of these is in the midascending colon and the second at the 15-cm mark, biopsy-proven from the outside hospital as adenocarcinoma.  Biopsy slides are being sent to GCGH as we speak, and we have discussed the possible options of management of these chronic masses.  The concern is this lesion near the rectum and we are evaluating this further with a rectal endoscopic ultrasound in addition to a pelvic MRI with a rectal coil in case that this is invading the rectum then preoperative radiotherapy may need to be considered.  A PET CT has also been arranged for further evaluation of the extent of disease.
#2 Numerous colonic polyps
This is suggestive of FAP, and outside biopsies have returned as tubular and tubulovillous adenomas.  We have requested an extended EGD with side view for evaluation of any duodenal polyps prior to his surgery to address the best surgical option of this.  Mr. Ortiz has been scheduled to see Medical Genetics.
#3 Preoperative evaluation
Mr. Ortiz is being scheduled for an ECG, chest x-ray, and lab work.  His performance status is 1, and he has no significant comorbidities.  We have emphasized the importance of him remaining off any tobacco substances.  If his preoperative evaluations return as normal, then he is okay for surgery.
This case was discussed and supervised by Dr. Calderon and Carolyn Ruhl our nurse practitioner who was present in the subsequent consultation.

Evaluation of recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the bowel and numerous polyps within the colon.

Mr. Ortiz is a very pleasant 42-year-old gentleman from KY North Carolina, who was seen in the Gastroenterology Clinic accompanied by his wife.  He comes here for further evaluation and treatment for recently-diagnosed adenocarcinoma in his bowel with numerous polyps within his large bowel also seen.
From a symptom standpoint, Mr. Ortiz states that for the last year he has been having intermittent discomfort below his right rib.  Two-to-three months ago, while playing baseball with his child, he noticed more discomfort in this area and in the last week of May this discomfort became persistent and associated with a slight fever.  He continues to have one bowel movement a day on a daily basis, but over the last six-months he has noticed this becoming a little looser but has not noticed any blood per rectum.  He gets occasional constipation with the last episode six-months ago where during these episodes he developed symptoms consistent with hemorrhoids and bright-red blood on the tissue paper.  His weight has, otherwise, been stable, and he has had no change in appetite, no symptoms of nausea or vomiting, and no dysphagia.
He went to his local physician on the 5th of July for evaluation of this persistent right upper quadrant pain, and a CT-scan demonstrated a 7.7-cm x 5-cm x 5.6-cm mass in the cecum.  He had a subsequent colonoscopy performed at an outside hospital on the 13th of July which showed a large obstructing, ulcerating, partly necrotic mass in the midascending colon just distal to the cecum.  Also, an ulcerated infiltrating mass was seen at the 15-cm mark and innumerable 1- to 3-mm polyps were seen within the colon.  Biopsies of these two masses returned back as adenocarcinoma, and the biopsies of the polyps that were removed were tubular or tubulovillous adenomas.  Mr. Ortiz informs me that the actual biopsy slides are on their way to GCGH and should arrive here today.
Mr. Ortiz's local care providers were planning for him to have surgery, and Mr. Ortiz and his wife thought that it would be prudent to have a further evaluation performed here.
