#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Peebles service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Valencia, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
Mr. Burton has decided to receive his adjuvant chemotherapy at the BH.  In preparation for this, I have ordered a followup evaluation in four weeks which will include a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel, postoperative evaluation with Dr. Pullen, consultation with his primary oncologist, Dr. Amato and a consultation with a general surgeon for Port-a-Cath placement, as well as preordering chemotherapy in anticipation of initiation of treatment.  I have emphasized to Mr. Burton that if things change and he does not feel he would be ready for treatment in four weeks he is to contact Dr. Blanchard office.  He verbalized understanding, and many questions were answered to his satisfaction.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Lane J. Pullen, M.D. (567-7167).

Collaborated by:  Francis Valencia, M.D.
Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N1 [mesenteric nodule]).

I was asked by Dr. Pullen's service to visit with Mr. Burton for postoperative education purposes.  He is a very pleasant 60-year-old male from Minneapolis Goose Lake.
1.  September 2009:  Noticed some bright-red rectal bleeding as well as increased constipation and intermittent cramping low abdominal pain.
2.  September 30, 2009:  Presented to Dr. Calcote for evaluation. Chest x-ray was negative for metastasis.  CEA was normal at 2.0 ng/ml.
3.  October 2, 2009:  Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential sigmoid rectal carcinoma at 15-cm from the anal margin with subtotal obstruction.  The tumor extends over a distance of 4-cm and invaded into but not through the muscularis propria on ultrasound.  A 7 x 5-mm peritumoral lymph node was suspicious for metastasis but not biopsied due to location.  Biopsy of the mass was consistent with moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  Some erythema and two small ulcers were noted in the descending colon.  Biopsies from this region showed focal active colitis but no evidence of neoplasm.
4.  October 5, 2009:  CT-scan revealed "Enhanced circumferential thickening of the proximal rectum eccentrically greater on the right with luminal narrowing would be in keeping with patient's primary rectal carcinoma. Within the central pelvic mesentery anterior and inferior to the left common iliac vessels is a somewhat spiculated 1.7-cm nodule in keeping with a metastasis. In addition, there is a 5-mm left perirectal lymph node (series 2, image 68) of uncertain significance but possibly representing a developing metastatic lymph node. No other masses or lymphadenopathy within the abdomen or pelvis. Normal liver."
5.  October 6, 2009:  Patient evaluated by Dr. Pullen who recommended preop chemoradiotherapy.
6.  October 9, 2009:  Patient evaluated by Dr. Saxton who recommended preop chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine.
7.  October 19-November 20, 2009 - received external-beam radiation treatments with concurrent Xeloda chemotherapy for a total dose of 5040 cGy.
8.  January 4, 2010 - taken for low-anterior resection by Dr. Pullen.  There was no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology: grade 3 adenocarcinoma with treatment effect forming a 2.5-cm x 2.2-cm x 1.3-cm ulcerated mass in the rectum with 50% tumor viability.  This was invading through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  There was a separate satellite nodule which measured 1.7-cm x 1.5-cm x 1.4-cm of viable moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The surgical margins were negative, and 3 of 24 regional lymph nodes showed mucin pools with no viable tumor consistent with treated metastasis.
Mr. Burton is continuing to recover from surgery and was up ambulating during our consultation today.
