#1 Rectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis, status-post neoadjuvant therapy
Plan is for him to undergo a total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy by Dr. Jessie Lin Monday, March 22, 2010.  Please see Dr. Gillis consult note for details.  He will be able to get off of his balsalazide following surgery.
#2 PAME
As he had been on steroids for two-months back in July of last year, I have communicated with the primary service he will need a stress steroid prep.  He has been cleared by Cardiology and has had no other significant cardiac symptoms.  Since he was cleared a few months ago, I feel he is an acceptable candidate to undergo the proposed procedure.  I recommend restarting his Plavix as soon as it is reasonable postoperatively.
#3 Hypertension
Well-controlled.
#4 Hyperlipidemia
Stable.
#5 Anemia secondary to neoplastic disease
He may require transfusions after surgery.  Type and screen has been performed.
#6 CAD
Has been cleared by Cardiology.  Currently Plavix on hold in anticipation of surgery.
Preoperative instructions reviewed.  He has been marked by Enterostomal Therapy, and teaching had been done previously.  I will state an addendum for his chest x-ray that is still pending.
ADDITION
Mr. Chase's chest x-ray returned and was unremarkable.  There had been no change since December 7, 2009.  No evidence of metastatic disease.

Mr. Chase is seen back for a listing appointment prior to scheduled total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy for rectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Chase is an established patient initially seen by Dr. Lin and I in December for rectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis. Neoadjuvant treatment was recommended. Mr. Chase underwent 17 radiation treatments and Xeloda but unfortunately developed significant diarrhea and was hospitalized from January 25 to February 12 for severe diarrhea secondary to his chemotherapy and problems with what sounded to be an ileus.  It was decided by his local oncologist that he could not tolerate additional treatment and is here for definitive surgery.
Restaging studies performed today include a CEA at 1.1.  This had been 0.7 on December 7.  His other lab work was unremarkable except that he is still mildly anemic with a hemoglobin of 12.5 and a hematocrit of 36.5.  An updated CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and compared to his December study revealing an increase in size of a few retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Otherwise, there were no other significant changes. He still has wall thickening and mucosal enhancement in the rectosigmoid colon consistent with his rectal cancer.  A chest x-ray is pending.  In regard to his ulcerative colitis, he has been taken off his Imuran since we saw him, and he is currently on  balsalazide.  He was also started on folic acid per his local provider.  He is moving his bowels approximately eight times a day which has been his normal recently.  He is intermittently having rectal bleeding, but not daily.  He did not require blood transfusions during his hospitalization.  After his hospitalization, he required TPN from hospital discharge on February 12 until March 8 or 9th.  Since that time, his appetite has been good, and his weight today is almost back-up to his weight when we saw him in December.  He overall has felt good and is getting back to normal activities.  His last day of treatments, both chemotherapy and radiation was January 22, 2010.
In regard to his cardiac status, he was seen for preoperative clearance with his coronary artery disease and history of multiple cardiac stents by Dr. Jerome Robinson in December, and it was felt he would be an acceptable candidate for anesthesia without further investigation. He has been holding his Plavix with his last dose on March 14, 2010, in preparation for surgery, and this will need to be restarted as soon as this is appropriate postoperatively per our cardiology colleagues.  He denies chest pain or recent shortness-of-breath.  He has not needed nitroglycerin.  He did have problems with hypotension for awhile, and for a temporary period of time his Diovan and metoprolol were decreased, but in the last couple of weeks this has been increased back to his normal dose.  He has been doing well since the change.
He denies having fevers or chills since hospital discharge.
