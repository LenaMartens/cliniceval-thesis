#1 T4N1 adenocarcinoma of the colon
With T4b disease due to penetration of the small-bowel wall, plus 2 involved regional lymph nodes, the patient has stage IIIC disease. MRI of the abdomen on July 21st did show "abnormal signal on multiple sequences replacing fat in the liver hilum and extending along biliary ducts and portal vein branches" but this was not consistent with metastases and seemed more likely to represent the same fibrotic reaction seen in the mesentery and periportal region.
We would typically recommend adjuvant FOLFOX in this setting. I have outlined the treatment course of FOLFOX and provided the patient with both a written and verbal description of possible side-effects. She is most concerned about the emetogenic nature of chemotherapy, given her past difficulties with nausea/vomiting; she has responded well previously to Zofran and I explained that this agent could certainly be used to ameliorate chemo-induced nausea. I also made her aware of our large armamentarium of antiemetic agents, including Aloxi and Emend. She is also concerned about being properly healed before proceeding with chemotherapy [a valid concern in light of her diabetes and elevated HgbA1c] but I explained that it would be reasonable to wait to initiate chemotherapy up to 2 months post-operatively. Finally, she understands that Port placement would be necessary for infusional 5-FU.
She is still trying to select an oncologist in 64502 who will be caring for her in the adjuvant period. We may also ask the Colonel Florence A Blanchfield Army Hospital pathologists to perform kras mutation analysis to see if EGFR-directed therapy may play a role in her future care.
Please see my consultant's note for further recommendations. Thank-you.

Resected T4 adenocarcinoma of the colon

The patient is a 53-year-old female with the following clinical history:
1) She experiences a severe episode of pancreatitis in 1977, complicated by abscess formation and a colonic perforation requiring a resection and temporary diverting colostomy.
2) In 2009, she develops post-prandial abdominal pain and is diagnosed with gastroparesis [likely related to diabetes-induced autonomic neuropathy], which improves on erythromycin but this medication is discontinued in March 2010 due to concern for tachyphylaxis.
3) In June 2010, she is seen in Colonel Florence A Blanchfield Army Hospital Gastroenterology for management of her abdominal pain. She is also found to have a microcytic anemia (MCV = 77.5, Hgb = 11.6). CT enterography performed on June 17th to investigate her postprandial discomfort reveals "extensive retroperitoneal calcifications with retraction of the stomach and transverse colon into the base of the mesentery" as well as "a focal area of wall thickening and surrounding lymph nodes in the mid-descending colon". Colonoscopy was recommended to evaluate the colonic lesion.
4) A colonoscopy performed on July 16th in 64502, California demonstrated a 7-cm partially obstructing mass at 50cm, with biopsies indicating an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
5) On July 27th, the patient proceeds to the operating room for a right hemicolectomy, with surgical pathology showing: "Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming an 8.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm mass in the descending colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and directly invades other organs or structures (small-bowel wall).  There is a prominent foreign body reaction within the small-bowel.  Lymphatic vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor. Multiple (2 of 11) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N1] (7th edition, 2010)."

As above, plus: diabetes [HgbA1c > 11, complicated by neuropathy], dyslipidemia, & ITP. Her surgical history includes: open cholecystectomy in 1992 & vaginal hysterectomy without oophorectomy in 1994.

Upon interview, the patient confirms the above clinical history. She notes ruefully that, in retrospect, she would have pursued colonoscopy sooner but was attributing her abdominal pain to her known gastroparesis. She had not had a complete colonoscopy since her abdominal catastrophe in 1977.
