#1 Status-post R1 resection for recurrent colon adenocarcinoma in the retroperitoneum
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Skinner service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Pichardo, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
We recommend that Mr. Schrupp receive chemotherapy.  He does not plan on returning in the outpatient setting for formal evaluation, and therefore, I will ask Dr. Pichardo to visit with him prior to dismissal for formal treatment evaluation.  I informed him that if the need arises in the future, we would be more than happy to help facilitate care, but at this point we will not make followup appointments for him per his request.  He verbalized understanding.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

I was asked by Dr. Walter's service to visit with Mr. Schrupp for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Schrupp is a very pleasant 57-year-old male from West, Iowa.
1.  November 2005 - taken for surgery for what was thought to be diverticulitis, but ultimately was found to be a T4 (perforated colon), N0, M0 sigmoid adenocarcinoma.
2.  2005 - given adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy which was overall tolerated well.
3.  February 2009 - developed a small-bowel obstruction which was thought to be related to adhesions.
4.  July 2009 - PET/CT-scan was performed for followup and showed increased FDG uptake in a mass at the aortic bifurcation.
5.  September 2009 - taken for surgical resection of the retroperitoneal mass and drainage.  Debulking was performed.  Thought to be consistent with an abscess, but final pathology ultimately showed that the retroperitoneal abscess contained metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colon cancer.
6.  October 2009 - CT-scan showed a large mass between the common iliac vessels and encasing the vessels.
7.  October 2009 - seen by Dr. Taylor Baird of Radiation Oncology and Dr. Walter of Colorectal Surgery.  The joint consensus was to have the patient return home and receive external-beam radiation treatment and concurrent radiosensitizer chemotherapy with ultimate plan for surgical resection with IORT.
8.  October 29, 2009 - December 9, 2009 - received Xeloda chemotherapy with concurrent radiation.  This was overall tolerated well.
9.  January 2010 - Repeat imaging showed negligible decrease in the retroperitoneal mass.  He was noted to have an elevated creatinine.
10.  January 12, 2010 - due to elevated creatinine, a right ureteral stent was placed.  Unable to place a left stent.  Ultimately had a left nephrostomy tube placed.
11.  January 18, 2010 - taken for surgical resection by Dr. Walter.  Per the operative note, the tumor was adherent to the mesentery of the small-bowel in the region of the previous anastomosis and was unable to be completely resected as it would require extensive reconstruction of the urinary tract.  It was debulked as much as possible and given IORT.  Surgical pathology from biopsy of the mesentery was consistent with a grade 3 adenocarcinoma with a colon primary.  The sigmoid mesentery biopsy was also consistent with grade 3 adenocarcinoma.  The aortic bifurcation posterior margin was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, and the aortic bifurcation biopsy was also consistent with grade 3 adenocarcinoma.
Mr. Schrupp is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
