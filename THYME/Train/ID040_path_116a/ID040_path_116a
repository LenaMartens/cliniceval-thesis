Final Diagnosis
A.	Sigmoid colon and rectum, left hemicolectomy:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated (grade 3 (of 4)), forming a 4.1 x 3.2 x 0.7 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolic fat.  Minimal treatment effect is identified.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (1 of 15) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma.

B.	Colon, sigmoid, distal ring, excision:  Unremarkable bowel identified grossly.

C.	Colon, sigmoid, proximal ring, excision:  Unremarkable bowel identified grossly.

D.	Lymph node, hepatic artery, biopsy:  A single (1) hepatic artery lymph node is negative for tumor. 

E.	Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Mild chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (7 cholesterol stones ranging in size from 0.7 cm to 2.4 cm).  A single (1) cystic duct lymph node identified.

F.	Liver, left lobe, biopsy:  Involved by metastatic grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3 N1 M1] (7th edition, 2010). 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled ""portion of sigmoid, portion of rectum"" is a left hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 27 cm in length portion of colon.  There is a 4.1 x 3.2 x 0.7 cm polypoid mass within the sigmoid, 5.1 cm from the mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the mucosal muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by HAZLEY

B.	Received fresh labeled ""distal sigmoid anastomosis ring"" is a 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm portion of unremarkable bowel with indwelling staples.  Gross only.  Grossed by WILES. 

C.	Received fresh labeled ""proximal sigmoid anastomosis ring"" is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm portion of unremarkable bowel with indwelling staples.  Gross only. Grossed by WILES.

D.	Received fresh labeled ""hepatic artery lymph node"" is a 2.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by WILES. 

E.	Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 9.7 x 4.1 x 2.5 cm gallbladder with a 0.9 cm maximum wall thickness, and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is identified.  There are multiple (7) cholesterol stones ranging from 0.7 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension.  No masses are grossly identified.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by RIDDLE.

F.	Received fresh labeled ""liver biopsy - left lobe"" is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm aggregate of pink-tan tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by RIDDLE.
