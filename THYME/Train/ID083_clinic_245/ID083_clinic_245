#1 Rectal cancer
As he is currently on Plavix and he has very high-risk peripheral vascular disease as well as carotid stenosis with stenting, I feel it would be best to evaluate him with a pelvic MRI rather than an EUS for his rectal cancer.  He has already had a staging CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  I discussed with him that these two areas in the lung are indeterminate but likely too small to show up on PET scan or to be biopsied.  These will need to be followed serially to see if they change in size.  His CEA was elevated before.  We will get a pelvic MRI and have him seen by one of our surgeons.  I have asked him to prep with a couple enemas before his return so a flexible sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy can be performed to help evaluate him for surgery.  I discussed with him he can continue on his Plavix at this time as he is going to need a large medical work-up likely prior to surgery, and we have not planned a surgical date so he can return on this based on the recommendations of Fawcett after he has his leg problem treated next week.  Once we set-up a surgical date, he will need to be off his Plavix if possible, and we will be setting him up to be seen in General Internal Medicine for a preanesthesia medical evaluation.  Discussed the potential for neoadjuvant therapy depending on the findings of his MRI and studies.  We will get basic lab work and updated liver function tests due to his alcohol use and heavy acetaminophen intake recently.
#2 Continuous alcohol use/abuse
I am concerned about his heavy drinking, especially with the amount of acetaminophen that he is taking with the oxycodone/acetaminophen.  I discussed at length the importance of him decreasing his alcohol use (1) so he does not have withdrawal symptoms when he has his surgery and (2) because of his high narcotic use for his pain.  This was discussed in the presence of his wife as well.  He says he will work on trying to cut down.
#3 Severe COPD, dependent on oxygen
Appears stable per his report at this time.
#4 PAME
He is quite complicated with many health problems, and once we have a surgical plan (he is seeing our surgeon to decide whether he needs neoadjuvant therapy versus surgery first), we will have him be seen in our General Internal Medicine Department for a full PAME to see if he is a medical candidate for surgery.  We will get a screening EKG as I know our internal medicine colleagues will want an updated one.
#5 Neuropathic pain
I discussed with him as he is still drinking heavily and he is taking so much of the oxycodone/acetaminophen that he needs to stop this, and I prescribed him just the oxycodone by itself so he is not getting high doses of acetaminophen with his drinking.  I discussed with him that I will only give him about a week's supply until he sees the doctors at Fawcett for treatment.  However, this has been the only thing that has been helping his pain which has been severe, and I can tell this in the office during my evaluation as he cannot sit still.  Discussed the importance of him getting on a stool softener twice-a-day.  With his high narcotic use and because of his cancer, I do not want him to become obstructed or have problems.  I also instructed him to increase his fluid intake.  Added docusate sodium to his medication list and changed him to just oxycodone in his medication list appropriately.
#6 History of elevated glucose
We will get updated hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose.
Spent 60 minutes with Mr. Conner and his wife reviewing the plan of care.  I will see him on Monday following his MRI and see him with the surgeon to determine the plan of care for surgery or for neoadjuvant therapy initially.  He was seen with his wife.  All questions were answered.

Mr. Conner is seen at the request of Dr. Anderson for evaluation of rectal cancer.

Mr. Conner is a 67-year-old male from Cayuga North Babylon who was found to be anemic a couple months ago and was encouraged to undergo a colonoscopy.  Per his wife's report, he had been encouraged two-to-three years ago to undergo a colonoscopy, but as he had a terrible experience after hemorrhoidal banding many years ago, he was reluctant to ever have a colonoscopy.  Eventually he conceded and underwent a colonoscopy on May 18, 2010, revealing a 3-cm, partially-circumferential mass in the rectum.  Pathology slides have been reviewed here confirming invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, noted at 15-cm per the outside colonoscopy report.  This was tattooed.  He also had multiple other polyps found.  It is mentioned he had polyps in the cecum, hepatic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon that ranged from 5 to 14 mm in size.  In reviewing his outside pathology slides, his cecal polyp was a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia with the cauterized margin negative for dysplasia.  His descending colon polyp was a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  The sigmoid colon was a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia, and there was another sample that just had colon polyps with pathology consistent with fragments of tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  He had sigmoid diverticula, but has never had a history of diverticulitis.  He has a family history of colorectal cancer in his mother who developed colon cancer at age 70 and underwent surgery and did not need adjuvant therapy.  She died later in life of what is suspected to be heart problems, not from her cancer.  He has not noticed obvious bleeding with bowel movements.  He is moving his bowels once to twice-a-day without constipation or diarrhea, and this has been his pattern for a long-time.  He denies anal pain or abdominal pain.  His weight has been stable, although recently his appetite has been a little bit decreased, and he has been a little more fatigued.  He has had staging performed.  His CEA locally from Pittsburg, which is in our medical records, was 3.2 on May 4, 2010.  A CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on May 19, 2010, and has been reviewed here.  This revealed thickening in the rectum consistent with his rectal cancer.  There was mild, hazy, fatty stranding noted.  No lymphadenopathy.  His liver was negative. An outside chest CT was performed on April 20, 2010, revealing two small nodular opacities in the left upper lobe that are indeterminate.  He also has a history of severe COPD and is on chronic oxygen therapy at 3 L per minute.  His most recent chest x-ray was performed and reviewed here dated May 19, 2010.  This revealed hyperinflation and had not significantly changed since his prior chest x-ray in our system from 2008 except he had a right lower lobe infiltrate at that time.
His main complaint today actually is neuropathic pain down his left leg.  He has paresthesias down his left leg and has been followed for this problem in the Back Clinic at Fawcett.  He is scheduled to follow-up there on Friday, June 11, for an epidural injection.  He plans to go off his Plavix tomorrow in preparation for the injection.  He has had other treatments there, on March 17 a bilateral L3 to L5 medial branch block as well as on March 26, 2010, bilateral L3 through L5 radiofrequency neurotomy were performed.  In the last week, his pain has significantly worsened.  He was initially tried on Tramadol which was not effective as the Vicodin.  Now he is on oxycodone/acetaminophen, taking 11 to 12 daily, approximately two every four hours.  His pain is a 10, and after he takes the pills this goes down to 7 to 8, but it has worked the best for him compared to all the other pain medications.  He has difficulty just sitting in the chair in my office due to this discomfort, and he says he is not going to have treatment for his rectal cancer until he has this problem addressed or improved pain control.  Of concern, he drinks 6 to 12 beers, five to six days a week and has been doing this for five years.  His wife marked on the form she was concerned about his drinking, but he informs me he is not concerned about it.  He denies drinking in the morning.  He is willing to try to cut down, but he is not sure he can cut down to just two a day.  For him CAGE is negative.  He is not taking other over-the-counter medication for his pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/LIMITED EVALUATION
1.  Severe COPD.  He is on 3 L of oxygen continuously.  His COPD has been stable.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.  He has had stenting of the common iliac arteries, both the right and left, I believe, in 2008 for severe claudication.
3.  Carotid stenosis.  He is status-post left carotid angioplasty with stenting.  In reviewing some of his reports, it looks like the last time this was evaluated his stenosis was 67%.  He is followed with a CT angiogram of his carotids to monitor this, and it has been discussed, in reviewing his records, if his CT angiogram reveals greater than 80% occlusion or if he becomes symptomatic, an additional stent may be needed with balloon angioplasty.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Neuropathic pain.  Discussed above.
6.  History of elevated glucose.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY/LIMITED EVALUATION
1.  Left carotid angioplasty with stenting.  I am not sure of the date, early 2009 per his wife.  It appears that he was seen back, and it was stable as of February 2, 2010.
2.  Balloon angioplasty and stenting of the right and left common iliac arteries in June, 2008.
