Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, portion sigmoid and rectum, resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 5.1 x 4.2 x 0.7 cm polypoid mass in the sigmoid colon, 5.2 cm form the resection margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat, focally.   The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (17) regional lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

AJCC, 7th ed, pT3N0.

B.  Colon, sigmoid margin, anastomotic ring:  Grossly unremarkable anastomotic ring identified.

C.  Colon, rectal margin, anastomotic ring:  Grossly unremarkable anastomotic ring identified.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion sigmoid, portion rectum"" is a 22.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon.  There is a 5.1 x 4.2 x 0.7 cm polypoid mass located 5.2 cm from the nearest mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass extends to muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by SLUSSER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid margin"" is a 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm proximal sigmoid margin with no gross abnormality.  Gross only.  Grossed by SLUSSER.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""rectal margin"" is a 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm portion of distal rectal margin with no gross abnormalities.  Gross only.  Grossed by SLUSSER.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, portion sigmoid and rectum, resection:  Invasive adenocarcinoma extending into the pericolonic fat locally.   Margins are negative.  Awaiting lymph nodes on permanent sections.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Leslie G. Lantz, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Chris Blanchard, immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed on paraffin-embedded colon adenocarcinoma tissue sections (block A5).  The staining showed intact expression of all four enzymes.  These findings fail to provide evidence of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) due to defective DNA mismatch repair.
