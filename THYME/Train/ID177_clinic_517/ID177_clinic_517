I had a chance to review the outside CT scans as well as the comprehensive outside records with the patient.  Unfortunately, I was not able to see and evaluate the initial scans of March 11 since the provided CD was blank.  I did, however, see the CT-scan of May 18, 2010, which shows only small indeterminate lesions in the liver which could represent residues of the previously documented liver metastases.  According to the patient, at least five liver metastases were identified previously.
With regard to the future management of the patient's disease, we have to acknowledge that she has had an excellent response to therapy.  Her tumor marker CEA is almost normalized and was determined at 5 today.  I would think that the patient is a candidate for evaluation of a radical surgical approach with resection of the primary tumor and potential liver surgery.  To this end, would have to hold bevacizumab for at least six-weeks before the elective surgery.  I tried to call-Dr. Cook to discuss the situation with him, but I could not reach him right away.  My recommendation would be to administer one additional cycle of chemotherapy with FOLFOX without bevacizumab and then bring the patient back to Nanticoke Valley Memorial Hospital in about six-weeks for imaging scans including PET/CT-scan and an appointment with our colorectal surgeons as well as liver surgeons.
Mrs. Tolbert had many questions regarding this procedure, all of which were answered, and the patient was content with the information received.  Since we are in an indeterminate situation whether or not the patient would be a candidate for liver resection, I told her not to hold Coumadin for now, and we can arrange for her to be put on a perioperative heparin regimen when she is here and cleared for surgery.

Mrs. Tolbert is a very pleasant 66-year-old patient who has been referred to Medical Oncology by Dr. Cook to obtain an opinion regarding the future management of her metastatic colon cancer.
The patient underwent a routine colonoscopy on March 11, 2010, and was found to have a mass in the sigmoid.  Biopsies confirmed the presence of an adenocarcinoma.  The same-day a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which revealed multiple intrahepatic metastases.  The CEA was 145.  Subsequently the patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab.  After four cycles a CT-scan revealed an excellent response with almost complete resolution of the intrahepatic lesions and good response of the primary tumor to chemotherapy.
Dr. Cook then contacted me by e-mail.  We discussed the case briefly with regard to whether or not the primary tumor should be resected.  The patient was then referred to Nanticoke Valley Memorial Hospital for further assessment.
Upon presentation today, Mrs. Tolbert stated that she had well-tolerated the first six cycles of chemotherapy with the exception of sensory neuropathy.  No significant nausea or vomiting, no fatigue.  She did have apparently some coronary spasms with the first administration of 5-FU, which was dose-reduced for cycle two and then dose-escalated again.  The patient has not had any symptoms again so far.  She feels energetic and is motivated to move forward with tumor-directed therapy.
