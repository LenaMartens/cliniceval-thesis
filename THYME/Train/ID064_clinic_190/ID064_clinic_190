#1 Carcinoma involving the cecum, pathology pending
Circumstantially, based upon the scan and all available data, this tumor would seem most consistent with colonic primary adenocarcinoma with lymph node involvement.  At this juncture, we are still awaiting final pathology, but we undertook a discussion of the general situation - noting that our expectation that this will prove to be colonic primary adenocarcinoma involving lymph nodes based upon scans.  In this setting, if this turns out to be the case from pathology results, we indicated that adjuvant therapy would be our recommendation, and we discussed an approach which would use a FOLFOX treatment regimen combining infusional 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin.  We discussed, in particular, potential side-effects to the every two-week therapy, the requirement for infusional treatment with outpatient pump, and the need for a central catheter placement.  We reviewed that the reduction in risk of recurrence over five years would be, per my estimation, perhaps in the 50% to 60% range under ideal circumstances, and that the treatment could be modified depending upon toxicity, but would be expected to be about six-months in duration.
We also reviewed that there are several concerns that I have with regards to the patient's recent CT-scan.  First, although not clearly noted on the report from the radiologist, the patient has a right peripheral lung nodule near the base.  This is indeterminate, and we do not know whether this is new or old, because the patient apparently has had no prior CT scans.  Additionally, the difficulty in interpreting the patient's scans is that he has multiple cystic areas in the liver which appear to be benign, but which might potentially obscure metastases, as some of these lesions are too small to characterize.  The liver will also need to be followed closely as a result.
Additionally of issue in this situation is that the patient has a very heterogeneous-appearing prostate, which is concerning.  The patient has not had a PSA for some time, but all PSA's previously have been normal, and his urination is without difficulty.  We discussed that this is something that we will also want to follow closely additionally.
I have recommended because of these considerations that, when the patient is considered for chemotherapy three-to-four weeks postoperatively, a restaging CT-scan to include chest, abdomen, and pelvis be undertaken to ensure that there are no changes which would otherwise inform recommendations for therapy.
At this point, despite the travel required, Mr. Rock is wishing to return to Woodburn Hospital for interval evaluation in this time period.  We discussed, however, that it would be not so practical for the patient to come back and forth for chemotherapy, and he agreed, and we discussed therefore his needs to establish as soon as possible a relationship with a home oncologist who could see him very shortly after recommendations are rendered at Woodburn Hospital so as to have someone locally to assume care of the patient.
All of the above was addressed in detail with the patient, his spouse, and his son, all of whom asked appropriate questions which I believe I addressed to their satisfactions.  I believe, overall, that Mr. Rock is vigorous enough to consider aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy.  The issue remaining, other than discussed above, is the fact that pathology is pending, and we will need to assure that this is consistent with expectation before making further and final recommendations.

Mr. Ortiz Rock is a delightful 83-year-old resident of South Carolina Des Moines, Iowa who is an avid skier, engineer, and industrialist, who presents to us referred by Dr. Thames for an opinion with regard to postoperative approaches to this patient with recently resected cecal tumor with pathology pending, but deemed most consistent with lymph node-positive adenocarcinoma of the colon.  Historically, Mr. Rock presented with some fatigue, shortness-of-breath, and anemia with a hemoglobin decreased to 8.6 g/dL ultimately leading to blood transfusion and colonoscopy identifying concerning area around the splenic flexure.  A right colonic circumferential cecal area mass was identified and resected by Dr. Thames, and we are seeing the patient in the wake of his recent surgery.
From a symptomatic standpoint, Mr. Rock was doing well, convalescing, and had no new complaints.  He was content with his progress.
Past medical history in Mr. Rock is significant for a mastectomy related to breast cancer.  This has been nonrecurrent.
