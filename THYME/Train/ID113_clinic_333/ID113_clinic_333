Mr. Hollis is a 40-year-old gentleman who presented with a few months worth of rectal bleeding.  On physical examination he has been found to have a palpable tumor.  Outside endoscopic ultrasound and colonoscopy revealed a mass in the rectum that is rather low-lying.  The remainder of the colon was negative as scoped.  Endoscopic ultrasound suggested a T3 tumor as well as nodal involvement.  Biopsy confirms grade 3(of 4) adenocarcinoma.  CT-scan shows a suggestion of at least one, if not more, liver metastases.  PET scan was also lit up in the suspected 2.5-cm liver metastasis. He has completed his course of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy and comes now for surgical management of this metastatic rectal cancer.
