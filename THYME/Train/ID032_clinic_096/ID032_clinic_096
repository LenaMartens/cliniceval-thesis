Mr. Ferguson Young is a 73-year-old gentleman who is seen at the request of Dr. Braithwaite.  His history and evaluation are well-outlined in a separate note from Lucedale, RN, CNP.
In brief, Mr. Young had presented to an emergency room in September with the onset of constipation, nausea, as well as weight-loss.  Mr. Young underwent workup at that time that showed a partially-obstructing mass in the sigmoid colon as well as what appeared to multiple hepatic masses.  In addition, a 3-cm mass was noted in the left kidney.
Biopsy of the obstructing mass in the sigmoid colon showed this to be a grade 3 adenocarcinoma.  Further workup showed the changes in the liver to be cavernous hemangiomas based on what appeared to be potentially resectable disease.  Mr. Young underwent surgery on October 26.
At the time of his surgery, Mr. Young had an en bloc resection of the sigmoid and rectum as well as the lower pole of the left kidney.  The resected specimen showed a 9.5-cm mass arising out of the sigmoid colon and invading into the adjacent ileum.  Twenty-four lymph nodes were resected which showed no evidence of any metastatic disease.  The surgical margins were noted to be negative within the resected portion of the kidney.  Mr. Young had a grade 2/4 renal cell carcinoma measuring 2.6-cm in size with no sarcomatoid differentiation.
I reviewed with Mr. Young the findings of his surgery.  Based on the staging of his colon cancer, Mr. Young is at increased risk for recurrence.  With extension of the tumor into the ileum, Mr. Young's risk for recurrent disease would be at least 30%.  As such, adjuvant chemotherapy is warranted.  I reviewed this in some detail with Mr. Young.  However, Mr. Young was adamant at this time that given his age and other factors, he does not wish to pursue adjuvant chemotherapy.  I did discuss with him that should the cancer recur it may not be curable at that time.  Mr. Young again expressed a good understanding and does wish to proceed with observation alone.  Based on this, I recommended that he undergo evaluation every six-months with blood work including a CEA.  Mr. Young's CEA was elevated prior to his surgery.
Mr. Young's kidney cancer appears to have been resected an early-stage.  At this point, there is no indication for adjuvant therapy.
Mr. Young does not have established health care elsewhere.  He does wish to return to GMC for ongoing follow-up.  I will discuss this with Dr. Georgie Mozee who saw Mr. Young in the preoperative setting.  If Dr. Mozee would like to see Mr. Young back in follow-up, I will have this set-up.  Otherwise, we will plan to have him seen in the GI Neoplasia Clinic in follow-up.
