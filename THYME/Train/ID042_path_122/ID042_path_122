Final Diagnosis
A.  Subtotal colectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 3.1 x 2.3 x 0.8 cm polypoid mass in the descending colon.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

B.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Benign fibroadipose tissue.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of ascending, transverse, descending, portion of sigmoid colon"" is a total abdominal colectomy specimen consisting of 82.0 cm in length colon.  There is an additional 19.5 cm length of bowel anastomosed to the proximal aspect.  No appendix is identified.  There is an 18.0 x 14.0 x 1.3 cm portion of omentum separately received.  A 3.1 x 2.3 x 0.8 cm  polypoid mass is present 14.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  There is a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm polyp with tattoo and a sutured area with puckered mucosa distal to the polyp.  The anastomosis site has a 3.1 x 0.9 cm area of ill-defined heaped up mucosa.  There is a 1.1 x 0.5 cm ulcerated area adjacent to the anastomosis site.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by JEAN
HOOPER
  Received fresh labeled omentum is a 15.0 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm portion of omentum.  No masses are identified grossly.  Lymph nodes are not identified.  Grossed by DAVIS.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Gladys Johnson, HNPCC screen will be performed on descending colon adenocarcinoma tissue sections (block A1); when completed, results will be available in LICZ GkyfUlvi.



Internal Comments
10/12/10--17 recuts to MG for HNPCC at request of Dr. Gladys Johnson/rjc
