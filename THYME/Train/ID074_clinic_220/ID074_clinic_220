#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N0, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Milner service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Young, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Please see Dr. Long note for a full plan of care.

I was asked by Dr. Wilbanks's service to visit with Mrs. Ivey for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mrs. Ivey is a very pleasant 44-year-old female with a long history of Crohn's disease.  She has had a fistulous tract which was ultimately resected with a high jejunostomy causing a mucous fistulous tract in the transverse colon, leaving approximately 100 cm of small-bowel.  She has also had Crohn's involvement of the small-bowel and perianal areas.
1.  June 1, 2010 - underwent a colonoscopy for increasing bowel movements and bleeding.  She was noted to have a large firm nodule in the rectum as well as rectosigmoid and anal lesions and ileal ulcerations.
2.  June 3, 2010 - underwent exam under anesthesia for a large perianal mass.  This was biopsied and consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma.
3.  June 4, 2010 - CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for distant disease.  Chest x-ray was also negative.
4.  June 7, 2010 - taken by Dr. Wilbanks for abdominoperineal resection and end colostomy.  Surgical pathology from the rectum and anus showed a moderate grade 3 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma forming a 2.6-cm x 2.2-cm x 1.0-cm mass in the anorectum junction arising in the background of villiform low-grade dysplasia and mild- to moderately-active Crohn's colitis invading through the muscularis propria and involving the perirectal adipose tissue.  There were negative surgical margins, and 18 regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  The tumor was staged at a T3, N0, M0 resected rectal adenocarcinoma.
