#1 Resected stage IIA (T3, M0, N0) colon cancer
Dr. Robin English was diagnosed to have a transverse colon lesion based on an abdominal CT-scan.  He had a colonoscopy that revealed a mass in the transverse colon that was biopsy-proven to be an invasive, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On June 21, 2010, he underwent an extended right hemicolectomy with a side-to-side ileotransverse anastomosis.  The pathology revealed a 5-cm ulcerated mass that was found to invade through muscularis into the pericolic fat.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion, surgical margins were negative, and 14 dissected lymph nodes were free from metastatic disease.  Dr. English has a stage IIA resected colon cancer.  There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting.  Dr. English can return to the GI Clinic for regular surveillance and follow-up.
#2 Urothelial neoplasm
Dr. English was incidentally noted to have a urothelial malignancy involving the left bladder wall, extending into the bladder neck.  This has resulted in a left-sided ureteric obstruction with a left-sided hydronephrosis.  Dr. English was offered a TURBT versus a cystectomy during his colon surgery, but preferred not to choose either of the options.  Dr. English will need to return to the Southeast Louisiana State Medical Office for further follow-up and management.
Thank-you for the consult.

Dr. Robin English is an 83-year-old gentleman with a recent diagnosis of a resected stage IIA colon cancer.  The outline of his oncologic history is as follows:
1.  The patient presented in May 2010 with right-sided abdominal pain and bloating.  A CT-scan from June 4, 2010, revealed a 5-cm long circumferential annular constrictive mass in the proximal transverse colon.  There was focal thickening or presence of a mass in the left posterolateral bladder wall with extension to the bladder base causing left ureteral obstruction at the uterovesical junction.  There was also evidence for moderate prostatomegaly.
2.  On June 16, 2010, the gentleman underwent a cystoscopy.  This identified a bladder tumor just lateral to the bladder neck.  The patient was offered a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor versus a cystectomy during his colon surgery, but opted to take care of the colon cancer first.
3.  On June 15, 2010, the gentleman underwent a colonoscopy that revealed a mass lesion in the transverse colon with numerous polyps in the left colon that were snared.  The pathology from the transverse colon lesion was consistent with an invasive, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The polyps were found to be tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia.
4.  On June 21, 2010, the patient underwent an extended right hemicolectomy with a side-to-side ileotransverse anastomosis.
5.  The pathology revealed a poorly-differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.1- x 5.0- x 4.0-cm ulcerated mass in the transverse colon.  The tumor was found to invade through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion seen.  The surgical margins of resection were negative.  Fourteen lymph nodes that were dissected were negative (pT3, N0, MX).
The patient is currently postoperative day No. 2.  He has done well without any pain, nausea, or vomiting.   No fevers or chills.
