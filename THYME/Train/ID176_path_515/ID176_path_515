Final Diagnosis
A.  Ascending colon, resection:  Poorly differentiated (grade 4 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 5.2 x 4.1 x 0.9 cm annular, circumferential and ulcerated mass in the ascending colon, 9.9 cm from the nearest margin (distal).  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  The remaining of the mucosa in the ascending colon and cecum show features of inactive chronic colitis.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration.  The terminal ileum is without abnormalities.  Multiple (4/48)  regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 3.1 cm of terminal ileum, 23.2 cm of colon, and a 9.2 x 0.4 cm appendix.  A 5.2 x 4.1 x  0.9 cm ulcerated annular, circumferential mass is present within the ascending colon, 8.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.   The mass is 9.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.   Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WARNER.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Dolph Sedillo (WMMH Ohio, San Antonio), HNPCC screen will be performed on right colon cancer tissue sections (block A5); when completed, results will be available in UVHO JggnZqxp.


Slide Disposition
8/25/10--17 recuts to MG for HNPCC screen at request of Dr. Dolph Sedillo (Bethesda PsycHealth Hospital, Ohio, San Antonio); campus auth current; 8/17/10 outside records in Synthesis from Dr. Sedillo indicate request for HNPCC would be phoned to TSH/jordan
