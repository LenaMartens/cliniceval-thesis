#1 Small-bowel obstruction
This is likely related to the radiation therapy.  Given that this is the first episode, I do not know that I would pursue this any further at this time.  I am obtaining a plain film of her abdomen, just to have a baseline before her endoscopy evaluation, which is likely to put some gas in there, so at least we will have a baseline.  I have talked to her at length about how the radiation may lend itself to adhesions and obstruction, but unless there was a recurring pattern, we would not intervene.
#2 Rectal bleeding
The patient had rectal bleeding.  This could represent radiation vascular changes, but given that her last colonoscopy was eight years ago, we would definitely recommend repeat colonoscopy using MoviPrep.
#3 Dyspepsia
The patient has intermittent heartburn.  She only uses topical antacid, taking three or four times a week.  It does not trouble her enough to take it once-a-day, but given the persistent symptoms I think a repeat evaluation with an upper endoscopy is warranted.  I will see her back after the endoscopic evaluation and make further recommendations at that time.
#4 Radiation enteropathy
It may well be that she would benefit from taking an antibiotic periodically.  She seems to have gotten sustained relief from taking the antibiotics in the hospital.  I will discuss this further with her when she returns.

The patient has a history of cervical cancer, treated with radiation therapy in 1980.  She had done extremely well having occasional loose bowel movement up until June of 2010.  At that time, she developed what sounded like a small-bowel obstruction.  She had some symptoms earlier while on a trip that lasted for a couple of days.  At-home, she developed nausea and vomiting and abdominal discomfort.  She vomited for about six hours and was taken to the local hospital, where she was found to have small-bowel obstruction by CT.  The patient was treated conservatively without NG suction.  She had a bit of a relapse when she initially tried to eat, but ultimately returned back to her baseline after several days.  She was doing well until about 10 or 12 days ago, when she developed an episode of rectal bleeding.  It was quite a bit of bleeding.  It was not clear if it was mixed with the stool or on the surface.
It was recommended at-home that she have a colonoscopy.  She was scheduled to come here in the fall for a procedure, so she came early.  The patient thought she had a colonoscopy four years ago here, but in fact it was in 2002 prior to her cholecystectomy.  At that time, she had some internal hemorrhoids, but nothing else of significance.
She has no abdominal discomfort now.  Her abdomen is back at its baseline.  She had not had any prior rectal bleeding.  She has no perirectal burning or itching.  She was not lightheaded when this occurred.  She did note that when she was initially admitted to the hospital, and she was given antibiotics that her bowel habit changed, and she went to the bathroom less frequently.

Abdomen:  On examination of her abdomen now, she is fairly flat with some minor tympany on the right-side more than the left, but no clear distention.
