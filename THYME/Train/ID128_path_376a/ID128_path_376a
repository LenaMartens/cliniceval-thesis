Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and upper rectum, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative polypoid mass (3.8 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm) located 4.5 cm from the rectal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (6 of 32) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. [AJCC pT3N2]

B.  Rectosigmoid, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Rectosigmoid, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid and upper rectum"" is a 21.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon and rectum with a 3.8 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm ulcerative polypoid mass located 4.5 cm from the rectal mucosal margin.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by BREWER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""colon and rectum, proximal anastomotic ring"" is a 1.5 cm in length portion of unremarkable bowel.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by OBRIEN.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""colon and rectum, distal anastomotic ring"" is a 2.0 cm in length portion of unremarkable bowel.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by OBRIEN.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jessie Levitt k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded sigmoid colon tissue (block A1).  In addition, due to the patient's young age, reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC will be performed.  Upon completion of both, results will be available in UVJO ZtguPscj. 


Internal Comments
3/4/10--12 molgen recuts sent to MG for k-ras (requested by Dr. Tracy Holle) mutation analysis and ""reflexive"" MSI testing/hodapp
