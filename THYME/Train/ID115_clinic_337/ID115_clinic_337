#1 Low rectal cancer
Our plan is to proceed with APR tomorrow.  The patient will not allow blood transfusion other than through a Cell Saver.  We will plan on doing an open approach in order to minimize any possible injury or problems that might lead to bleeding.  I discussed with her in detail the risks of the surgery, the main risks being wound infection either of the perineum or of the midline.  We also discussed hernias either at the stoma site or at the midline.  She is well aware that she will end up with a permanent stoma.  A permanent stoma also has problems associated with hernias or obstructions in the future.  She understands the risks of urinary dysfunction and possibly needing a catheter for awhile.  Other risks discussed with the patient included blood clots, cardiac events, pneumonia, and recovering from the surgery which are all part of issues that could be related to her recovering from the surgery.  After a long discussion of the risks, alternatives, and benefits, the patient agreed to proceed tomorrow with an open abdominoperineal resection.  After all this was discussed, the patient was marked.  Consent form was signed with the appropriate caveats related to blood transfusion.

Rectal cancer.

This is a 72-year-old woman whom I had seen previously with a very low rectal cancer which basically started in her anal canal.  She underwent chemoradiation therapy which she tolerated well.  Restaging has not shown any progression of the disease.  She is now here in preparation for surgery.
