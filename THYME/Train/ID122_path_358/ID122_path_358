Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid and anus, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 to 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.2 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm) located in the anal canal, 1.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades just into the muscularis propria.  Angiolymphatic invasion is present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.0 cm, distal margin).  Multiple (8) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
