This is a 70-year-old gentleman with colon cancer based on outside pathology presenting for the below concerns:
#1 Colon adenocarcinoma in the transverse colon
He was asymptomatic till his surveillance colonoscopy.  He has an excellent functional status.  He has not undergone further staging evaluation.  We will pursue this further at this time.
#2 Postnasal drip
Will provide him with some Allegra and Flonase to see if this provides him symptomatic relief.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.  Will pursue routine lab tests.
2.  Will obtain a CT abdomen and pelvis.  He is a getting chest x-ray, and we are going to be reviewing the outside pathology here.
3.  We will defer colonoscopy at this time, since the area in question was tattooed.
4.  He will follow-up with surgery and us after these tests are complete.
5.  Perioperative clearance.  He has not had difficulties with anesthesia previously.  He has no family history of adverse reactions to anesthesia or known bleeding disorder.  He does have open-angle glaucoma. He  had a recent EKG stress test on 5/13 that where his heart rate reached 80% of predicted and no evidence of ischemia was noted.  He would be a low-risk candidate for a moderate-risk procedure and would, otherwise, be cleared to undergo anesthesia.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

This is a 70-year-old gentleman with a personal history of colon polyps presenting for the below concerns:
#1 Colon adenocarcinoma
Mr. Locher was in his usual state of health when he underwent screening colonoscopy May 7, 2010.  His last colonoscopy was five years ago.  At that time, he was noted to have a polyp, the details of which are unknown but prompted them to pursue another colonoscopy within five years.  During the colonoscopy, the prep was excellent.  They were able to make to the ileocecal valve.  They did note an 8-mm polyp in the cecum that was sessile; however, they were able to remove it with a hot snare completely.  In addition, they noted a 5-cm polypoid sessile mass in the transverse colon that was ulcerated.  Biopsy in the cecal lesion was consistent with a tubular adenoma; however, biopsy of the transverse colon ulcerated mass was consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma that was moderately well-differentiated.  The outside colonoscopy report did state that a tattoo was placed.
He has not undergone any other evaluations at-home for this.
He states that he has been feeling good.  He denies any symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in his bowel habits including constipation or change in his stool caliber, fatigue, weight-loss, hematochezia, melena, or hematemesis.
#2 Sore throat
This has been ongoing for the past two-weeks.  This has been associated with postnasal drip and a nonproductive cough.  Denies fevers, chills, sinus pressure, or purulent nasal drainage, just occasionally clear rhinorrhea.
