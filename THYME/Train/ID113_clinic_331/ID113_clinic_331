#1 Metastatic rectal cancer
I had a long discussion with the patient and his wife regarding the natural history, prognosis, and treatment option for his disease.  Despite this metastatic disease, he understands that complete resection of all disease, ideally with additional adjuvant local-regional, and systemic therapy gives him a reasonable opportunity for cure.
There are a number of ways that a person could proceed at this time.  Optimal local-regional therapy would include some form of preoperative radiation followed by surgery.  One approach sometimes used by our radiation oncologists in this situation would be five fractions of radiation in five days followed shortly thereafter by his definitive surgery.  We could then give him six-months of our most active adjuvant chemotherapy including 5-FU and oxaliplatin.
If it is felt that a response to chemotherapy and radiation preoperatively might be necessary to increase the chance of sphincter preservation, then I would favor proceeding with five/six-weeks of neoadjuvant radiation along with radiation-sensitizing 5-FU or capecitabine chemotherapy.  This would then be followed by an operation and four to six-months of adjuvant 5-FU and oxaliplatin.
We did discuss that there have been Phase II trials that have incorporated oxaliplatin into a neoadjuvant radiation-sensitizing chemotherapy program.  Early results of randomized trials have suggested this does not increase the pathologic complete response rate and may increase diarrhea and other toxicity modestly.  However, the motivation for considering the addition of oxaliplatin would not necessarily be to improve local-regional therapy but to allow systemically-effective doses of combination  chemotherapy to be given right upfront in the face of his metastatic disease.  This perhaps might also improve tumor response in the rectum, but this is not proven.
I discussed the uncertainty with him of adding this.  This is an evolving field, and there is yet no compelling evidence to tell us that this is going to improve or not improve long-term outcomes in terms of the control of distant metastatic disease.
At the end of our discussion, he understands the fluoropyrimidine radiation-sensitizing chemotherapy would be our recommendation, but certainly the addition of oxaliplatin, generally a weekly dose of 50-mg/m2 in most studies, could be considered as a very reasonable, although aggressive intervention.
The patient's CBC and chemistries are unremarkable.  CEA is 7.1.
I discussed in detail and answered all their questions.  He will be receiving treatment closer to home.  He understands to let the surgeons know as he is completing his preop therapy so that he can return for surgical evaluation approximately a month later.
#2 Young-onset rectal cancer
We will have his tissue blocks called and tested for microsatellite instability and other markers of possible HNPCC.  This information might affect his surgical resection and certainly affects counseling regarding personal and familial risks of cancer going forward.

Metastatic rectal cancer.

I am asked to see Mr. Smith Hollis by Dr. Gale Lawrence in General Surgery here as well as referral from Dr. Ashley Stilwell, his oncologist in Muncie, IN 47306.
Mr. Hollis is a generally-healthy 40-year-old gentleman who presented with a few months' worth of rectal bleeding.  On physical examination he has been found to have a palpable tumor.  Outside endoscopic ultrasound and colonoscopy revealed a mass in the rectum that is rather low-lying.  The remainder of the colon was negative as scoped.  Endoscopic ultrasound suggested a T3 tumor as well as nodal involvement.  Biopsy confirms grade 3(of 4) adenocarcinoma.
CT-scan shows a suggestion of at least one, if not more, liver metastases.  PET scan was also lit up in the suspected 2.5-cm liver metastasis and nowhere else.  PET scan also showed some mild uptake in the esophagus which might be consistent with inflammation, and CT-scan shows some small pulmonary nodules that certainly are likely benign.
The patient has no symptoms of obstruction or pain with bowel movements, abdominal discomfort, or anything else.  He works as a lumbar salesman.  He has two children.
He came to PHHC for discussion of the optimal integration of local-regional, and systemic therapy for his metastatic disease.

He does have a maternal aunt with history of colon cancer in her early 50s.  His mother and her other four siblings do not have any malignancy.  Maternal grandmother had breast cancer but in her 70s.  Younger sister did have a colonoscopy recently, but he does not know the result.  He also has a younger brother who has not been screened.
