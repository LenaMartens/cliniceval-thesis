Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, transverse, segmental resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming an 11.0 x 7.0 x 1.5 cm circumferential, ulcerative mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor directly invades through muscularis propria and into the adjacent omentum.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Mesh is identified in the omentum.  A single lymph node demonstrates involvement by direct extension, while an additional 25 lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
