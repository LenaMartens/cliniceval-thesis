Blood work obtained on January 21, 2009:  Hemoglobin 9.3.  Hematocrit 20.1.  Platelets 355.  White count 7.2.  INR 1.6 (obtained on January 20, 2010).
Electrolytes obtained January 21, 2010:  Sodium 139.  Potassium 3.6.  Chloride 106.  Bicarb 23.  BUN of 6.  Creatinine 0.5.
Echocardiogram (January 25, 2010):
Final Impressions:
1.  The study was performed while the patient was in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
2.  Small left ventricular cavity, no regional wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction 50%.
3.  Mild mitral valve thickening (consistent with age), moderate functional mitral regurgitation.
4.  Severe left atrial enlargement.
5.  Normal right-sided findings (RV size and function, RV systolic pressure, right atrial size, inferior vena caval caliber).
6.  No pericardial effusion.
Colonoscopy (January 7, 2010):
Postop Diagnosis:
1.  Fair/adequate prep.
2.  Limited colonoscopy to the distal sigmoid due to an obstructive lesion.
3.  Diminutive polyps of the rectosigmoid, removed.
4.  Internal hemorrhoids.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
History and physical findings were reviewed in detail with Dr. Delbert Taylor.  Together we have developed the following plan:
#1 Chronic atrial fibrillation
Ms. Miller was admitted to the Winchester Health Center Service for further evaluation of her chronic atrial fibrillation in the setting of a hypotensive episode.  We will continue to monitor heart rate and rhythm along with serial cardiac markers and electrocardiograms to rule her out for any cardiac involvement.  We will continue on with her rate-control medications of metoprolol 100-mg twice-daily and her Coumadin therapy of 5-mg by mouth in the evening.
#2 Dehydration
We will start Ms. Miller on a normal saline infusion at 75 an hour for a total of 1 L.
#3 Code status
Code status was addressed with Ms. Miller.  She wishes to remain full code during this hospitalization.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Learning needs assessment done.  Barriers assessed (cultural, religious/spiritual, motivational, physical/cognitive, language, emotional).  Ready to learn. Patient has no barriers.  Explained diagnosis and treatment options.

Ms. Miller is a very pleasant 78-year-old female who was directly admitted to the Winchester Health Center Service from the Monterey.  She was transferred with recurrent atrial fibrillation.  Ms. Miller reports that during her exercise therapy this morning, she became very fatigued.  Blood pressure was obtained and found to be decreased, systolically in the 80s.  Her caregiver thought it would be best for her to be directly admitted to DH for the evaluation of her atrial fibrillation and possible hypotensive episode.
Ms. Miller was hospitalized on October 29, 2009, with complications of diverticulitis requiring IV antibiotics.  She was noted to be in atrial fibrillation at that time, and a cardiology consult was obtained.  Two-weeks prior to this admission, she underwent colonoscopy for continued loose stools which was terminated early because of a stricture noted in the distal sigmoid and mucosal changes suggestive of an adenopathy lesion.  The day following her colonoscopy, she developed left lower quadrant pain which appeared to be a blood blister overlying the skin.  This blood blister burst, and she was readmitted to the hospital.  Her INR at that time was noted to be supratherapeutic at 5.7, so her Coumadin was held.  She was given 4 units of FFP.  Colorectal Surgery was consulted.  Recommendations were given to resume the Cipro and Flagyl and obtain a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This study revealed large pericolonic abscess with findings concerning of a perforated colon cancer.  A 4-mm ground-glass nodule was also present in the apical/posterior portion of the left lower lobe of the lung.  A drain was placed under CT guidance. Her Coumadin was resumed on dismissal.
Ms. Miller presents today with possible dehydration, hypotensive episode, and chronic atrial fibrillation.  Upon further interview with the patient, she reveals that she does not keep hydrated.  We will continue with her rate control of metoprolol tartrate 100-mg twice-daily along with her Coumadin therapy.  Her cardiac history includes chronic atrial fibrillation diagnosed April of 2008.  She continues on rate-control therapy along with anticoagulation.  She also has a remote history of a transient ischemic attack in 2008, well-controlled hypertension, obesity, and diverticulitis.
Ms. Miller's cardiac risk factors include hypertension, family history and being postmenopausal.
