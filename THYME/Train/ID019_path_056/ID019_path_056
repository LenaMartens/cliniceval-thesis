Final Diagnosis
A.  Ascending colon and proximal transverse colon, colectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon.  The tumor invades the submucosa but does not involve the muscularis propria.  No angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The appendix shows a mucinous cystadenoma with low-grade dysplasia, which is completely excised. Multiple (2) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (measuring 0.3 and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) and a 0.3 cm inflammatory polyp are identified in the ascending colon.  Multiple (22) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor [AJCCpT1N0]. The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (closest margin, distal, 15.0 cm). 

Seen in consultation with Dr. Leslie Allen.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ascending colon and proximal transverse colon is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 5.0 cm of terminal ileum, 26.0 cm of colon, and a 7.0 x 0.9 cm appendix. A 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm annular mass is present within the ascending colon, 11.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent. The mass is 15.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 1.3 cm from the radial margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat. There are multiple pedunculated polyps ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by BROWN.

A.  Ascending colon and proximal transverse colon, colectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon.  The tumor invades the submucosa but does not involve the muscularis propria.  No angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The appendix shows a mucinous neoplasm with low-grade dysplasia.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (closest margin, distal, 15 cm).  Two tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (0.3 cm and 0.9 cm) and a 0.3 cm inflammatory polyp are identified.  Multiple (22) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor [AJCCpT1N0].  Hold over for further evaluation of appendiceal neoplasm on permanent sections.
