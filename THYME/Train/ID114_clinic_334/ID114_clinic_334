#1 Young-onset rectal cancer
I discussed the treatment of rectal cancer with Mr. Ammerman.  We discussed various surgical possibilities, and he is aware that diverting ileostomy is a distinct possibility especially given his height and weight.  His BMI is 34.5.  He would like to have surgery with Dr. Monica Dixon from Colon and Rectal Surgery if at all possible, and therefore this has been arranged for later this week.  His preoperative staging films will be sent to Radiology for interpretation, and we will restage with lab work, chest x-ray, and CT abdomen and pelvis after which he will meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery.  I have also asked for a visit with Enterostomal Therapy for preoperative education should temporary diversion be necessary.  His initial tumor was described at 10-cm from the anal verge, and a tattoo has been placed, although I see that this was placed two days after beginning neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, patient is OK for anesthesia.
I discussed with Dr. Ashley Donovan, note to follow.

Mr. Ammerman is a 44-year-old gentleman who presents for surgical treatment of rectal cancer.  Mr. Ammerman has had hematochezia since 2007.  He sought medical evaluation in 2008 and was diagnosed with a hemorrhoid and possible fissure.  Unfortunately his rectal pain and bleeding progressed, and he developed trouble passing stool.  He ultimately underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy November 12, 2009, which showed a bulky tumor at 10-cm.  Biopsies taken were positive for adenocarcinoma.  Staging PET CT on November 13, 2009, was negative for metastatic disease.  The primary mass was positive for FDG uptake.  He underwent another flexible sigmoidoscopy December 2, 2009, with tattooing of the primary lesion.  MRI demonstrated a stage IIIB tumor with several small lymph nodes noted that did not light up on PET.  He, therefore, was treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation with infusional 5-FU and received 5040 centigray of radiation.  His treatments were given November 30, 2009, through January 8, 2010.  He participated in the NSABP R04 randomized trial with his local oncologist.  His labs had demonstrated a hemoglobin as low as 9.5.  His first colonoscopy February 17, 2010, was negative for additional lesions.  The distal aspect of the tumor margin was noted 2-cm proximal to the site of tattooing.  A standard colonoscope could not pass through this circumferential tumor, and therefore a pediatric scope was utilized to reach the cecum.  He presents now for surgical resection and would like to avoid a stoma, even temporary, if possible.
Comorbidities include gastroesophageal reflux disease with occasional dysphagia.  He has no odynophagia or hematemesis.  He has intentionally lost 30 or 40 pounds last fall through the use of diet and exercise.  He states he also has an irregular heartbeat, as does his mother and a sibling.  This does not result in dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, fatigue; chest pain, pressure, discomfort; or shortness-of-breath.  His childhood asthma has resolved.  He denies a history of known sleep apnea.  He has never smoked and has no history of bleeding disorder, anesthesia reaction, thrombosis, glaucoma, or medication allergy.
