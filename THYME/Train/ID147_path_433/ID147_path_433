Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low anterior resection:  Grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 2.3 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm polypoid/ulcerated mass in the rectum, located 1.4 cm from the distal surgical resection margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  There is a separate tumor nodule forming a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm submucosal mass located 1.0 cm proximal to the main rectal tumor.  Multiple (5) pericolonic microscopic tumor deposits are identified in the mesenteric adipose tissue.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4 of 20) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma.
