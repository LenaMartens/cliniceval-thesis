Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an annular mass (8.5 x 5.2 x 2.5 cm) located in the ascending colon, 5.2 cm from the proximal ileal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  The appendix is unremarkable.  The distal and proximal surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  The omentum shows mature adipose tissue; negative for tumor.  Multiple (38) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
