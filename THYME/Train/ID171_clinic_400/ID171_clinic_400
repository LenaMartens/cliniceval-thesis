#1 Probable descending colon cancer based on outside evaluation
We will proceed with indicated blood work, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, colonoscopy including further biopsies, and colorectal surgery consultation.  If colonoscopy is incomplete due to obstructing lesion, we will attempt to arrange CT colonography postprocedure for exclusion of proximal neoplasia.
#2 Carotid bruits by physical exam
We will obtain carotid ultrasound.
#3 History of GERD
The patient describes infrequent dysphagia, primarily with bread products.  We will obtain EGD at time of colonoscopy.
#4 PAME
Patient would be okay for anesthesia for any upcoming surgical procedure related to colon cancer, pending results of blood work, EKG, and chest x-ray, which have all been ordered.
#5 Health-maintenance
Patient will follow-up with physicians closer to home for dermatology assessment and further ongoing prostate management.

Pleasant 68-year-old gentleman from Aaron, who experienced an initial episode of trace rectal bleeding approximately three-months ago, followed by occasional loose stools.  More significant rectal bleeding episode occurred on 5/4/10 prompting emergency room visit elsewhere.  Mild anemia was noted, and patient was referred for colonoscopy.  Procedure was performed on May 10, 2010, and an obstructing mass was noted in the descending colon.  Biopsies were taken, but reports are currently unavailable.  Given the suspicion for descending colon cancer, patient chose to arrange urgent appointments at H C Watkins Hospital for further diagnostic and staging evaluation.
Denies change in energy level or weight-loss.  Abdominal discomfort is infrequent and mild if present.  Appetite has been slightly diminished over the past several days.
For potential PAME, patient denies recent syncope, vision changes, previous cardiopulmonary disease, blood thinner use, or prednisone use.  Can walk two blocks on a flat surface without any dyspnea or chest pain.
