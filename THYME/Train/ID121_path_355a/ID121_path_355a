Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph node, apical superior anal region, biopsy:  A single lymph node is negative for tumor.

B.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, low-anterior resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (2.1 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm) located in the rectum, at the distal aspect of the specimen.  The adenocarcinoma invades into but not through the muscularis propria.    Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  The tumor extends to within 1.0 cm of the distal margin (determined in vivo, intraoperatively) and 1.6 cm of the radial margin.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in a single (1 of 13) regional lymph node. 

C.  Rectum, additional distal margin, biopsy:  Negative for malignancy.  This specimen provides an additional 1 cm of tumor free margin.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""apical superior hemorrhoidal lymph node"" is a 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm lymph node.  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by RHODES.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon and rectum"" is a rectosigmoid specimen consisting of 55.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 2.1 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass is present within 0.5 cm of the distal margin and 1.6 cm radial margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by RHODES.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""additional distal rectal margin"" is a 2.3 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm portion of rectum without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by RHODES.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Lymph node, apical superior anal region, biopsy:  A single lymph node is negative for tumor.

B.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma within 1.0 cm of the distal margin.  The radial margin is uninvolved.  The tumor invades into but not through the muscularis propria on frozen sections.  Hold over for permanent sections to assess depth of invasion and lymph nodes.

C.  Rectum, additional distal margin, biopsy:  Negative for malignancy.
