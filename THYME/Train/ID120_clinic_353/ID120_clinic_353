#1 Rectal cancer
Mrs. Taylor has recurrent rectal cancer that has now been fully resected.  She had intraoperative radiation therapy, as well as neoadjuvant external-beam radiation therapy with capecitabine sensitization.  The patient tolerated this reasonably well.
Mrs. Taylor has also previously had a full course of FOLFOX and has had extensive radiation and previously had Avastin, as well.  At this point, given her multiple thromboses, it would be advantageous to try to avoid a long-term vascular catheter if possible.  At this point, I am not entirely sure that going back to oxaliplatin would be beneficial as she had a recurrence essentially six-months after FOLFOX plus Avastin.  There are also multiple studies showing a lack of efficacy of adjuvant or irinotecan-based regimens, so at this point given with her pelvic radiotherapy cytopenia's could be a problem, given the total scenario, as long as she recovers adequately for the surgery, I may consider adjuvant therapy with a capecitabine alone for a duration of approximately six-months, but I did urge her to see her primary oncologist, Dr. Hale, in about one-month to address these issues.  She is more than welcome to contact Ms. Lashandra Hayden, RN, CNP, or Dr. Coleman regarding further questions about her regimen.  She is high-risk for recurrence, but at this point she has had multiple prior therapies and complications thereof.

Mrs. Taylor is a pleasant 41-year-old white female who had recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma to the pelvis.  Her oncologic history is as follows:
1.  April 2006, developed change in bowel habits and abdominal cramping.
2.  April 13, 2006, colonoscopy identifying a rectosigmoid mass.
3.  April 19, 2006, underwent low-anterior resection with positive radial margin, T3 tumor, N0 (0 of 14 lymph nodes), 6-cm in size, K-ras positive.
4.  June 2006 to August 2006, bolus 5-FU plus leucovorin.
5.  August 21, 2006, to September 28, 2006, radiation for a total dose of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions.
6.  October 2006 to December 2006, bolus 5-FU and leucovorin.  Developed Port-A-Cath-associated clot, anticoagulated.
7.  December 2006 to August 2008, no evidence of disease recurrence.
8.  August 2008, elevated CEA to 6.1.  CT/PET scan showing suspicious area in the right adnexal region.  CT-guided biopsy suspicious but nondiagnostic.
9.  October 8, 2008, total abdominal hysterectomy and BSO.  Per operative note, right adnexal mass adherent to the lateral pelvic sidewall in the area of ureteral stricture.  Developed DVT associated with central line.  PICC line placed.
10.  November 2008 to March 2009, FOLFOX plus Avastin times ten cycles.  Had extensive nausea and vomiting not responsive to Compazine, not given any other antiemetics.  Also developed neuropathy in the hands and feet.
11.  March 2009, developed DVT associated with PICC line, removed.
12.  November 2009, small-bowel obstruction.
13.  January 2010, elevated CEA and small-bowel obstruction.
14.  January 16, 2010, taken for resection.  Surgery aborted due to extensive adhesions, but biopsies obtained of right pelvic sidewall mass confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Underwent bypass of small-bowel.
15.  March 22, 2010, evaluated by Dr. Coleman of Medical Oncology, Dr. Quiroga of Radiation Oncology, and Dr. Young of Colon and Rectal Surgery with joint consensus to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation with hopeful surgical resection with IORT.  Due to Mrs. Taylor's multiple problems with thrombosis from PICC lines and central catheters, Dr. Coleman deemed infusional 5-FU inappropriate and recommended Xeloda as a radiosensitizer.
16.  April 21, 2010, Xeloda plus concurrent radiation treatment.
17.  Radiation initiated.  Due to multiple insurance problems, Xeloda not able to be started until April 27, 2010.
Mrs. Taylor returns in the outpatient setting for further evaluation and treatment of her recurrent colorectal cancer.  Presently, overall, she notes since initiating Xeloda she has overall had very minimal side-effects.  She has not noticed an increase in her bowel pattern but continues on Paregoric and Lomotil three times a day.  She always has diarrhea, but this has been persistent since her bypass surgery, and she has up to seven bowel movements a day which again is her baseline pattern.  She has no abdominal or pelvic pain and only uses Norco one tablet once-a-day at night to help sleep.  She has a good appetite and has maintained her weight relatively well, however, over the last two-weeks she has lost an additional 5 pounds.  She notes overall she is eating well, however.  She has had no hand/foot syndrome.  She has no mucositis or stomatitis.  She has no fevers or night sweats.  She has noticed a decreased energy level and naps during the day but sleeps well at night as well.  She has no shortness-of-breath, chest pain, or peripheral edema.  She notes the pain she was previously experiencing in her abdomen has resolved.
Mrs. Taylor currently has a resected locally recurrent rectal cancer.  She is recovering from her surgery fairly well.  She is on clear liquids at this point.
