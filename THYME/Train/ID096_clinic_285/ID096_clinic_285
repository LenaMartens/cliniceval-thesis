#1 Resected rectal adenocarcinoma with prostate involvement
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Vanover service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Adams, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
As briefly discussed with Mr. Peloquin, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended.  Mr. Peloquin has been made aware of this by his local medical oncologist and does plan on following-up with him.  Therefore, I will not make followup appointments for him, but certainly if the need arises in the future, I would be more than happy to facilitate care.  I will ask Dr. Adams to visit with him prior to hospital dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.

I was asked by Dr. Brock's service to visit with Mr. Peloquin for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Peloquin is a very pleasant 74-year-old male from Virginia.  He has a past medical history significant for Crohn's disease for over 50 years.  He has had multiple problems with perirectal abscesses.  He was also treated with Remicade with overall improved symptoms.
1.  January 2010 - evaluated initially at Glenwood Hills Center.  CT imaging showed a large right-sided rectal abscess.  Underwent drainage and catheter placement by Dr. Brock.
2.  May 2010 - returned for evaluation with CT imaging showing a left-sided rectal mass.  Underwent I&D of a mucinous cyst in the rectum as well as biopsies of this area, which confirmed mucinous adenocarcinoma.
3.  June 2010 to July 2010 - underwent chemotherapy (infusional 5-FU) with concurrent radiation done in a neoadjuvant approach in Virginia.
4.  September 8, 2010 - underwent abdominoperineal resection by Dr. Brock.  Per the operative note, the resection was difficult due to multiple scar tissue and previous fistulas and abscesses.  Surgical pathology from the sigmoid, rectum, and anus (abdominoperineal resection) notes a microscopic focus of residual grade 2 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma with abundant acellular mucin pools forming an ill-defined 7.1-cm x 6.0-cm x 4.1-cm mass with minimal to moderate response to therapy.  Multiple perianal and perirectal abscess cavities were identified, and 19 regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  Negative surgical margins, although the radial margin was free of tumor by 0.4 cm.  A soft-tissue right prostate region nodule was focally involved by grade 2 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma.  A left prostate nodule was also focally involved by grade 2 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma.  A nodule in the region of the prostate was also involved by grade 2 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Mr. Peloquin is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
