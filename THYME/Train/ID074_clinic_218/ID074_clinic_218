Mrs. Ivey is a 44-year-old woman with a  history of small-bowel and perianal Crohn's disease. She has had multiple operations with a large resection of small-bowel and colon. She has 100 cm of small-bowel estimated left and did well after surgery. She has been treated with adalimumab, 6-MP, and infliximab. Currently she is on Humira weekly.  More recently she has had worsening in her symptomatology with an increase in her stools, perhaps eight stools daily, and a discrete episode at night of lower left-sided cramping abdominal pain and tightness that resolved over a period of about four hours.  She then had some perianal symptoms with some bleeding.  An exam under anesthesia on June 3, 2010 with excision of a perianal skin tag reveals pathology of invasive grade 4 (of 4) mucinous adenocarcinoma. She comes now for surgical management of this rectal cancer.
