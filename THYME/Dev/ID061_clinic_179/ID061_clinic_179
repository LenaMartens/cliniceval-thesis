#1 Ulcerated mass in the sigmoid colon worrisome for malignancy
Discussed development, staging, and treatment of colon cancer with Mr. Uy.  At this time we will proceed with staging lab work including CBC, chemistry panel, CEA, and given the sweats also check a TSH level.  He will obtain a chest x-ray and a CT abdomen and pelvis and then have him meet with Colorectal Surgery for surgical recommendations.  Patient will need to meet back with Cardiology for preoperative clearance, especially given his cardiovascular disease, history of headaches, and possible vascular disease.  Discussed plan of care with patient and answered questions.
Discussed with Dr. Hood, note to follow.

Mr. Uy is a 56-year-old gentleman who was referred for sigmoid colon cancer.  Please see pertinent medical history below for details pertaining to his cardiovascular status.
Briefly, he underwent bare metal stent placement August 11, 2010, for non-ST MI.  While hospitalized in Critical Care Unit on heparin integral and Plavix and aspirin he developed rectal bleeding.  This developed on three occasions, and his first colonoscopy August 13, 2010, was positive for an ulcerated mass in the sigmoid colon.  The bowel preparation was suboptimal.  Pathology demonstrated high-grade dysplasia suspicious for invasion.  Please see family history below for other cancers in the family including a daughter with colon cancer at age 32.  MSI testing was negative.  Mr. Uy, himself, has intentionally lost over 50 pounds since March.  He notes constipation.  He does not complain of abdominal pain presently.  His bleeding has resolved.
Mr. Uy has numerous other health issues, particularly from a cardiovascular standpoint.  He is status-post PTCA March 17, 1998, at the age of 43 and then had a triple-vessel bypass graft September 22, 1999.  He has had stents placed subsequently October 17, 2006, June 20, 2009, and as previously stated most recently August 11, 2010.  He currently takes anticoagulation with aspirin 325-mg daily (although was prescribed baby aspirin two tablets daily) in addition to Plavix.
There is a question of whether Mr. Uy had a stroke.  He is not familiar with this.  He does struggle with chronic headaches, and apparently a neurology evaluation is pending.  He apparently had a head scan in Louisiana that was unremarkable for a cause.  He requires Vicodin for sleep and headache treatment.  He also developed sweats.  He has significant depression that is not well-managed with his Effexor.  He states he just has a lack of motivation.  He has been diabetic for approximately 14 years and now is on both insulin and oral agents.  He quit smoking in 1999.  He has sleep apnea for which he uses a CPAP.  He denies any bleeding disorders or anesthesia reactions historically.  He has no medication allergies.
