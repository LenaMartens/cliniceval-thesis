Mr. Walker is a 91-year-old gentleman who was found to be anemic and subsequently had colonoscopy.  They found a cecal polyp that was removed piecemeal and then an obvious cancer in the splenic flexure.  The splenic flexure cancer was clipped and dyed.  A subsequent CT-scan shows the clips right in the splenic flexure.  The pathology report showed obvious cancer in the splenic flexure.  The cecal polyp was all benign except for a small fragment that had some cancer cells in it, and the pathologist said this may likely be contamination from the cancer in the splenic flexure.  In this 91-year-old gentleman, I do not think we should do a subtotal colectomy.  I plan on treating the cecal polyp as a benign polyp with a small contaminated biopsy and just proceeding with a segmental resection of the splenic flexure.  He will need to have a colonoscopy in a year to follow-up on the cecal lesion.  I discussed procedure, alternatives, and risks with the patient and his wife and answered all questions.
