Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 0.5 x 0.4 cm focus arising in a tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia (2.6 x 1.9 x 0.3 cm).  The tumor is located 2.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades into the submucosa.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  A single (of 15) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT1N1] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid and portion of rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 27.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 2.6 x 1.9 x 0.3 cm polypoid mass is present within the rectum, 2.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 2.1 cm from the radial margin.  There are multiple (greater than 50) diverticula within the sigmoid colon.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by JENNINGS.


Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Cory Overton (231-958-09578), k-ras mutation analysis will be performed by Great Falls Center on paraffin-embedded rectal polyp tissue (block A2).  When completed, results will be available in JIET FiojKsre (Documents/Notes and Reports/Sent out Lab Test Report).


Internal Comments
7/1/10--6 molgen cuts to MML Referrals (send out to ARUP) for k-ras mutation analysis at request of Dr. Cory Overton/tutor
7/22/10--molgen HE & 1 molgen unst rec'd back from ARUP; to TR to file/rjc
