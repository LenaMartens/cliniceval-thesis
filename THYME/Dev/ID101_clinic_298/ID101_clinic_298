Labs drawn 3/22/2010:
Hemoglobin 14.6  WBC 2.9  PLT 249  Sodium 139  Potassium 5.3  Glucose 83  Creatinine 1.0  BUN 18  Chloride 104  Bicarb 26
22-Mar-2010 11:27:00  Exam: Chest-- PA & Lateral    Chest; 2 views: Thoracic curvature. Chest otherwise negative. Bilateral nipple shadows.
22-Mar-2010 10:54:00  Exam: US Abdomen Limited
Limited ultrasound of the liver is compared to the outside CT from 577-7055. No sonographic abnormality is identified in the liver. Specifically, no mass is identified to correspond with the indeterminate 0.7cm enhancing lesion seen on CT in the left hepatic lobe. This still likely represents a cavernous hemangioma or less
likely an FNH. This lesion does not have typical CT characteristics of a rectal carcinoma metastasis. If clinically indicated, an MRI of the liver could be performed for further evaluation.
11-Mar-2010 10:07:00  Exam: Interp of OS MR Abd and or Pel
Outside MRI of the pelvis without and with IV gadolinium enhancement 3/4/2010.
Circumferential, infiltrating mass of the rectum with direct extension to the perirectal fat plane on the right with associated perirectal adenopathy. The lesion abuts the mesorectal fascia at 9:00 position (series 7, image 10). Diffuse thickening of the mesorectal fascia, right-greater-than-left, with extension to the right seminal vesicle
with thickening of Denonvillers fascia (series 9, image 18). No gross invasion into the prostate. 1.4-cm x 2cm left external iliac adenopathy (series 9, image 11). Ileostomy right lower quadrant of the abdomen.
02-Mar-2010 15:52:00  Exam: Interp of OS CT Abd and or Pel
Outside CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast 10/18/2009.
Marked thickening of the rectum compatible with the patient's reported history of rectal carcinoma. Associated thickening of the ischiorectal fascia. There is no intervening fat plane between the rectum and the prostate and therefore local invasion cannot be completely excluded. The prostate itself is enlarged. Associated perirectal lymphadenopathy with the largest measuring 1.6-cm (series 2 image 58). Large left external iliac lymphadenopathy measuring 3-cm in short axis. 7-mm enhancing lesion involving the lateral segment of left hepatic lobe that parallels the enhancement of the aorta. These findings could represent a hemangioma. Would recommend an ultrasound examination for further evaluation. Focal fatty infiltration/altered perfusion involving the medial and lateral segment of left hepatic lobe along the fissure for the ligamentum teres anteriorly.

Rectal cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemo/radiation therapy.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

29-yr-old male with diagnosis of rectal cancer in the setting of FAP and neoadjuvant chemo/radiation therapy completed elsewhere. He is the first member of his family diagnosed with FAP.  He had obstructive symptoms and required a diverting stoma at-home.  Pretreatment CT demonstrates large rectal tumor which may abut the prostate. On images he also is noted to have bulky mesorectal lymph nodes and a large left external iliac lymph node.
He came to RH Salt Lake City for second opinion for surgical options. He decided to seek surgical care at RH Salt Lake City.
Post-treatment pelvic MRI does not demonstrate invasion of the prostate. The post-treatment CT demonstrates some decrease in the size of the lymph nodes.  The left external iliac lymph node is bulky and abuts the iliac vasculature. Ultrasound of the liver did not demonstrate metastatic disease. He is anticoagulated for history of liver infarct. He has been transitioned from Coumadin to low-molecular-weight heparin with his last dose on 3/21/2010 in the evening. He comes to the hospital at this time for surgical management.
