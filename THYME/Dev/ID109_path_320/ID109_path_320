Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, ascending, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a polypoid mass (4.9 x 3.4 x 0.6 cm) located in the cecum and ileocecal valve, 11.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 15) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma [AJCC pT3 N1 MX]

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum and ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 2.0 cm of terminal ileum, 15.0 cm of colon, and a 9.0 x 0.4 cm appendix.  A 4.9 x 3.4 x 0.6 cm polypoid mass is present within the cecum, involving ileocecal valve, 11.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  There are multiple (2) sessile polyps (1.0  cm and 1.4 cm in greatest dimension) located 1.4 cm from the closest (distal) margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PEAK.



Addendum Diagnosis
A tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated adenoma are also identified away from the main tumor lesion.
