#1  Resected Stage II colon cancer
Mr. Benefield is a pleasant 81-year-old male with resected colon cancer seeking treatment recommendations.
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. * service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed this case in detail with Dr. Garibay, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
In this situation, we are not recommending any adjuvant chemotherapy, and therefore, I am not making follow-up appointments for Mr. Benefield to return.  I will ask my colleagues in the GI Neoplasia Clinic to see Mr. Benefield in follow-up.  I will also ask Dr. Garibay to visit with Mr. Benefield prior to hospital discharge for formal treatment recommendations.  I did emphasize to Mr. Benefield that if the need arises in the future, we are more than happy to help facilitate care.
