#1 Recurrent rectal cancer with extensive presacral tissue involvement
Abdominal perineal resection, presacral tumor excision, possible full or partial cystectomy, and pelvic reconstruction is planned for October 29, 2010.
It was made known to the patient that if the procedure ended up being too extensive, there is the possibility that all parties may need to abort.
For the time-being, he will be on CRS enhanced recovery protocol.  Intraoperative findings may need this adjusted.

Mr. Palmer is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman from OH who presents to Dr. Mccoy Service for the chief complaint.  He has a previous history of neoadjuvant treatment and a low-anterior resection for rectal cancer back in December 2008.  He initially did well postoperatively; however, in April of this year, he had a followup CT-scan which demonstrated some changes around his bladder.  He underwent cystoscopy, and there was some erythema noted on the bladder mucosa.  Subsequent colonoscopy in June of this year demonstrated some inflammation at the rectal anastomosis.  He ended up having biopsy-proven recurrence of his cancer.  Workup here at Walthall has unfortunately demonstrated a large presacral mass encompassing some of the sacral nerves, the anterior portion of the distal sacrum, and probable involvement of the bladder as well.  He presents to Dr. Mccoy Service and multiple other surgical specialties for hopeful surgical management of his problem.
His past medical and surgical history is outlined below.
