Reviewed outside records as discussed in HPI.
#1 Young-onset rectal cancer
Discussed the development, staging, and treatment of rectal cancer with Mrs. Messersmith, as well as Lynch syndrome.  Given her young age of onset, she is agreeable to proceed with immunohistochemistry staining.  We will have her outside CT and chest x-ray sent to Radiology for interpretation, and will proceed with endoscopic ultrasound for staging purposes, after which she will meet with Colon and Rectal Surgery for consideration of surgical resection.  We discussed the role for neoadjuvant chemoradiation if T3 or N1 disease is identified.  It does not appear that a colonoscopy needs to be repeated.  I will follow-up with the patient throughout her examinations.
#2 Esophageal thickening on CT
An EGD will be requested at the time of her EUS.
Discussed with Dr. Kim Valenzuela.  Note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Young-onset rectal cancer.

Mrs. Messersmith is a 46-year-old woman who presents for evaluation and treatment of young-onset rectal cancer.  Mrs. Messersmith has had intermittent rectal bleeding for some time, which was primarily diet-dependent, aggravated by nuts, etc.  This was attributed initially to diverticulitis, as this runs in her family, however, became more persistent recently.  She underwent her first colonoscopy May 3, 2010, which was positive for a friable nodular mass 5-cm from the anal verge.  A few hyperplastic polyps were removed from the sigmoid colon at 30 cm.  There is no comment on diverticular disease.  Staging chest x-ray and CT abdomen and pelvis were negative for evidence of metastatic disease.  Incidentally noted on CT was thickening of the distal esophagus.  The patient is asymptomatic with no dysphagia, odynophagia, or reflux symptoms.  In addition to the bleeding, she has noted an increase in diarrhea.  Her baseline bowel pattern is one stool every one-to-two days.  Laboratory studies otherwise indicate a normal CBC with a hemoglobin of 15.8.  Her hCG was negative.
Comorbidities include hypertension, for which she uses hydrochlorothiazide.  She is also using levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.  She continues to smoke and plans to quit.  She is otherwise healthy with no cardiopulmonary disease.  She denies any chest pain, pressure discomfort, or shortness-of-breath.  She tends to lose weight when she is stressed out.
