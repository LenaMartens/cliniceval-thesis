#1 Resected sigmoid adenocarcinoma (T2, N1 (1 of 36), M0)
Mr. Uy is a very pleasant 56-year-old male with resected sigmoid adenocarcinoma seeking treatment recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Cory Jenkins through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent supervisory note.

Mr. Uy is a very pleasant 56-year-old male from Clearwater Louisiana.  He has a very complicated past medical history which is outlined in the Past Medical/Surgical History.
1.  August, 2010 hospitalized with and non-ST MI, placed on heparin, Plavix, and aspirin, developed rectal bleeding.
2.  August 13, 2010, colonoscopy performed identifying an ulcerated sigmoid mass.  Biopsies confirmed high-grade dysplasia with questionable invasion.
3.  August 30, 2010, repeat colonoscopy identifying again a sigmoid mass as well as an indeterminate 1.5- x 1.0-cm upper rectal mass that was also friable.
4.  September 2010, taken for low-anterior resection.  Surgical pathology of the rectosigmoid resection identified a grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 1.7- x 1.6- x 0.7-cm mass invading through the submucosa involving 1 of 36 regional lymph nodes and a separate tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia forming a 1.2- x 0.9- x 0.7-cm mass also identified; negative surgical margins; staged as a T2, N1 resected sigmoid adenocarcinoma.
5.  October 3, 2007, admitted locally with a partial small-bowel obstruction thought to be related to recent surgery as well as use of pain medications.  Imaging at that point did not show any evidence of distant disease.
Mr. Uy has been referred to the Burgess Family Medical Center Medical Oncology Division to discuss treatment options.  Presently, overall, he notes he has very mild diffuse abdominal pain characterized as 2 out of 10, does use any pain medications any longer since his recent hospitalization.  His appetite is good, and he has continued to try to be motivated to lose weight.  He has lost 50 pounds intentionally and does plan on losing another 50 to 70 pounds.  He has had no nausea or vomiting.  He has no fevers.  He has a preexisting history of idiopathic drenching night sweats.  He also has chronic headaches.  He has been seen by Neuropathy with no discernable cause.  He has a bowel movement once-a-day with no evidence of blood or mucus.  Overall energy level is diminished but slowly improving.  He has no chest pain.  He has no shortness-of-breath.  He has bilateral stable peripheral mild edema.  His neuropathy from his diabetes on his hands and mostly concentrated on his fingers as well as his feet up to his legs, occasional painful.  He does have sensation in these extremities, but it is diminished.  His blood sugars have been quite variable since his recent hospitalization, anywhere from 150 to 300, and he was recently taken off metformin, although he is maintained on insulin.
