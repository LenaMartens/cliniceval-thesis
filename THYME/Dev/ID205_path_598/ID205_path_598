Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, descending and rectum, resection:  Recurrent adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4), forming a 3.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm mass at the distal margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the radial resection margin but reactive fibrosis is present at the margin.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor, after submission of anus (see specimen B).  Multiple (11) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Tracy C. Stephenson, M.D.

B.  Anus, transanal excision:  Invasive, moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified, invading through the muscularis propria into perianal tissue.  The radial margin is negative for tumor by 0.1 cm, posteriorly.  The distal margin is negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Tracy C. Stephenson, M.D.

C.  Region of anterior anus, transanal excision:  Seminal vesicle, negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Tracy C. Stephenson, M.D.

D.  Anus, proximal presacral margin, excision:  Negative for tumor.

E.  Soft tissue, presacral space and coccyx, excision:  Scattered foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, focally involving the left and anterior margins (see final margin status in part F below).  The bone is not involved by tumor.

F.  Soft tissue, left presacral space, re-excision:  New margin negative for tumor.

G.  Liver, portion  segment II, wedge resection:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin, forming a single 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm mass.  The hepatic parenchmal margin is free by 0.3 cm.

H.  Liver, subsegment VI, wedge resection:  Calcified nodule.

I.  Liver, portion segment V, wedge resection:  Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma forming a 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm nodule less than 0.1 cm from the surgical resection margin.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Ricky Geisler (Roswell Park and Ankle Clinic, APO New York New York, Wellington), k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded anal tissue (block B2).  Upon completion, results will be available in UIAT AhfaZcbr.
