#1 Metastatic colorectal carcinoma, likely lung and liver metastases
#2 High-grade colorectal obstruction with obstipation
#3 Iron-deficiency anemia secondary to bleeding from colorectal carcinoma
Patient has metastatic colorectal cancer with liver and lung lesions.  Unfortunately, the main issue at this time is the obstructing nature of his primary tumor in the rectum.  Recent endoscopy showed a lumen of 5 to 7-mm, and he is in need of rectal stenting.  We have arranged for him to undergo endoscopy with placement of a rectal stent tomorrow.  We will then proceed with PICC line placement and initiation of chemotherapy next week.  We plan to administer FOLFOX plus Avastin chemotherapy for approximately two-months and then rescan.  We will then move forward with combined chemotherapy with radiation therapy in order to further shrink the mass in the distal rectum.  Our aim is to decrease the burden of disease in the rectum in order to facilitate surgical resection in the future.  He will also hopefully be a candidate for staged resection of his liver and lung metastases.
We plan for FOLFOX plus Avastin chemotherapy, again starting next week.  He does have bleeding with his bowel movements, which will hopefully be somewhat relieved by the stent procedure; however, if he has significant bleeding, we will need to hold Avastin therapy.  We will plan for two-months of chemotherapy alone prior to proceeding with the combined chemoradiation approach.  He will need to visit with Radiation Oncology tomorrow after his stenting procedure if possible.  He expresses desire to stay at the Walnut Grove Hospital during his combined chemoradiation therapy.  He plans to obtain most of his treatment here at Dowell Center.  I have gone over the regimen as well as potential side-effects with the patient and given him written handouts regarding the above information.
Patient is agreeable now to proceed with rectal stenting procedure.  He understands the procedure itself as well as the risks and benefits of the procedure.  I have given him prescriptions for Ultram and oxycodone if needed for pain symptoms.  I have also recommended that he start on Senokot-S two tablets twice-daily in order to avoid either constipation or worsening of his current symptoms.  I have also spoken with the patient regarding the rationale for PICC line placement for chemotherapy infusion.  He understands the risks and benefits of PICC procedure.
I have discussed the case with Dr. Thomas's surgical team as well as Dr. Dale Johnson.  All are in agreement with the above plan.

Patient is a pleasant 49-year-old man, previously healthy, who presents with a recent diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.  His recent history is summarized below as follows:
1.  July 2009 patient has bright-red bleeding per rectum and well as pain with bowel movements.
2.  September 2009 patient presents to the emergency room with pain with bowel movements and rectal bleeding.  He is treated for hemorrhoids.
3.  March 2010 patient has continued bleeding, weakness and obstipation along with narrow stool caliber.  Hemoglobin at that time is 10.1 with MCV 78, platelets elevated at 516,000 and normal liver tests.
4.  April 5, 2010, colonoscopy showed poor preparation, however, a mass was noted in the proximal rectum extending 9-cm proximally.  Biopsy was consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Iron studies at that time show ferritin 5, serum iron 18, iron-binding capacity 382.
5.  April 8, 2010, patient meets with a surgeon who recommends LAR.
6.  April 9, 2010, further staging including a CT abdomen and pelvis shows pulmonary nodules within the lingula and left lower lobe as well as several low-attenuation liver lesions, the largest superiorly and posteriorly in the right hepatic lobe measures 3.6 x 2.5-cm.  Thickening in the rectosigmoid junction and rectal wall with several small perirectal nodules in the presacral space with question of enlarged lymph nodes or extra serosal tumor implants.  Comments also include mildly thickened bladder wall as well as lucency in the left ilium.  CEA at this time is 8.3.
Patient returns today for his results following recent tests.
PET/CT-scan obtained shows rectal cancer with uptake in lymph node, hepatic, and pulmonary metastases.  Findings described are hypermetabolism in the large rectal mass with perirectal hypermetabolic adenopathy adjacent to the perirectal mass on both sides, indicative of lymph node involvement.  There is uptake in two liver masses, one in the dome of the liver as well as one in the right lateral part of the liver, likely metastatic.  Uptake in a-1-cm lung nodule in the left upper lobe in the perihilar region, likely metastatic.  A 5-mm lung nodule in the left lower lobe has mild uptake and due to the small size is indeterminate but could be metastatic as well.  No other areas of uptake noted.
Patient then went on to have flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies.  Reviewing the operative note, the tumor was encountered approximately 9-cm from the anal verge described as concentrically obstructing ulcerated mass consistent with his rectal carcinoma.  There is a relatively high-grade obstruction with an approximately 5- to 7-mm lumen present.  Multiple biopsies were obtained, consistent with invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma associated with an ulcer base.  K-ras and other studies are pending.  Patient has gone on to receive a transfusion of 2 units of RBCs due to continued bleeding and anemia.  He is meeting with Dr. Thomas's surgical team as well today to discuss the appropriate role of surgical intervention at this time or at a later date.
