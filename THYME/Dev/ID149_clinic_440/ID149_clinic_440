Mr. Kling returns postoperatively.  He is feeling much better at this time.  He was recently hospitalized over the weekend at a local hospital but slowly is improving and getting his strength back.  He is tolerating a regular diet.  I informed him he could eat whatever he would like but just gradually add in the increased roughage and fiber into his diet.  He complains of more constipation at this time.  I recommended he start a fiber supplement and drink at least eight glasses of water daily with this.  If he becomes more constipated, he can certainly take a dose of milk of magnesia.  He was recommended to return in one-year for a colonoscopy for re-evaluation of his colon.  He would like to return here for this.  A reminder will be sent to him by Dr. Manners appointment secretary.  All other questions were answered.  He is surgically dismissed.
