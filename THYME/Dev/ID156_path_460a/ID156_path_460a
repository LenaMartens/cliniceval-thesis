Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectum endoscopic biopsy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma associated with an ulcer base.  The results of the second specimen (part B), also from the rectum, will be reported in an addendum.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Addendum Diagnosis
B.  Rectum, biopsy:  Additional tissue from the rectum also reveals invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma associated with an ulcer base.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Drs. Jay Stacey Orr and Dale Johnson, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded recal tumor (block B1).  Upon completion, results will be available in BNSP RyixPzpe.  Also requested was PCR analysis for microsatellite instability.  Lack of normal tissue precluded this analysis; consequently, Dr. Johnson requested immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2.  The staining showed intact expression of all four enzymes.  These findings fail to provide evidence of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) due to defective DNA mismatch repair.
