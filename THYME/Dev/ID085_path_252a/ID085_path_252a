Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (4.2 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm) located 4.8 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (5 of 14) regional lymph nodes are positive for tumor.

B.  Sigmoid, descending colon margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

C.  Sigmoid, rectal margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

D.  Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes; hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:  Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma forming a 5.2 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm polypoid mass in the endometrial cavity with focal invasion into the underlying myometrium.  The margins of resection are negative for malignancy.  The cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

Case seen in consultation with Dr. Bobby A. Abreu

E.  Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (15) lymph nodes negative for tumor. 

F.  Lymph nodes, left para-aortic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple (10) lymph nodes negative for tumor. 

G.  Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (15) lymph nodes negative for tumor. 

H.  Lymph nodes, right para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (7) lymph nodes negative for tumor. 

I.  Liver, cyst wall, excision:  Benign simple cyst.

J.  Liver, segment 6, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.  Margins are negative for tumor.

K.  Liver, segment 3, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.  Margins are negative for tumor.

L.  Liver, segment 8, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary, forming 2 masses, 0.6 and 0.8 cm.  Margins are negative.

M.  Liver, segment 5, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary forming a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm mass present 0.7 cm from the surgical margin.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2aM1a] (7th edition, 2010).





Diagnosis Comment
Immunostains were performed on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of the mass in the uterus using antibodies directed against desmin, smooth muscle actin, caldesmon, and CD10.  The neoplastic cells show no significant positive staining with any of the markers tested.  These data support the above diagnosis of a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid"" is a 16.1 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon.  There is a 4.2 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm ulcerated mass located 4.8 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by FRANKLIN.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""descending colon"" is a 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm annular fragment of grossly unremarkable mucosal tissue.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WARE.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is a 1.9 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm annular fragment of grossly unremarkable pink-tan mucosal tissue.  Gross examination only.  Grossed by WARE.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""uterus, tubes, and ovaries"" is a 130.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries and cervix.  A single large polypoid heterogenous mass (measuring 5.2 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm) is present within the endometrial cavity and is attached to the fundus and posterior wall.  Focal invasion is present to a depth of 0.4 cm (total wall thickness is 1.7 cm).  The uterine serosa is smooth.  The endometrium is unremarkable.  There are no leiomyomata.   There is a 3.1 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm right ovary with a solid cut surface and an 8.3 x 0.8 cm unremarkable right fallopian tube which multiple paratubal cysts.  There is also a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm left ovary with a solid cut surface and a 7.8 x 0.8 cm left fallopian tube which is unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by ASHLEY

A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (4.2 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm) located 4.8 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple regional lymph nodes will be evaluated on permanent sections.

C.  Sigmoid, rectal margin, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

D.  Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes; hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:  Endometrial stromal tumor forming a (5.2 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm) polypoid mass in the endometrial cavity.  The cervix, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are grossly  unremarkable.  Hold to review immunostains on the mass to confirm the diagnosis.
