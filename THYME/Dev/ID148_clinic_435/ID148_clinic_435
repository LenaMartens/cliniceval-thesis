#1 Rectal cancer
Mr. Juarez has brought his outside pathology for review, and we will have that read here by Bay Shore Sanitarium.  He will go ahead and proceed with rectal endoscopic ultrasound to help with staging of his rectal cancer.  Although it seems that the left hepatic lobe lesion seen from outside was largely described as benign, we will go ahead and have both the CT as well as MRI over-read here by Texas Elks Care Center.  Should both of those over-read be equivocal, we may even consider an abdominal ultrasound, but I am hopeful that both MRI and CT will be sufficient.  We will arrange for him to meet with our colorectal surgeons, and should there be any evidence for invasive disease based on our evaluation, we will also make arrangements for him with our colleagues in Radiation Oncology for neoadjuvant therapy.
#2 PAME
Given Mr. Juarez's clinical history as well as functional status, he is able to proceed to any anticipated surgery regarding his rectal cancer without further evaluation.  A baseline chest radiograph, laboratory studies as well as EKG will be obtained for baseline purposes.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Rectal mass.

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Juarez is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman from Junction, without significant past medical history who presents for further evaluation of a rectal mass.  Mr. Juarez is originally from Elmer and understands English without difficulties but does have some difficulties with expression of the English language, so his family has assisted in the clinical interview.  They declined invitations for interpreter.  Approximately ten pages of outside material were reviewed.
Mr. Juarez was in his usual state of health until approximately three weeks ago when he developed hematochezia.  This occurred with every bowel movement and never outside of that.  Otherwise, on review on systems, he has otherwise felt quite well and denies any history of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, anorexia or early satiety, extraintestinal lesions, weight-loss, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, palpitations.  Over the past year, he has noted intermittent left lower quadrant abdominal discomfort, but this only occurs approximately two times per month and he described it as only occurring when he felt more stress.
Given his symptoms, he was seen by his local provider who sent him for a colonoscopy on March 22, 2010.  Review of the colonoscopy reports indicates that approximately 10-cm from the anal verge a 3- to 4-cm mass was seen with bleeding.  Multiple biopsies were obtained, and outside pathology reported tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia with a foci of intramucosal carcinoma with an invasive component.  A CT was done later that day which was only notable for a question of left hepatic lobe lesion at approximately 1.2-cm.  This was felt likely to be a cyst but indeterminate.  An MRI of the abdomen was done on March 24, 2010, from the outside; and they reported this as most likely a left hepatic lobe cyst and most likely benign in nature.
In terms of functional status, he is able to climb two flights of stairs without difficulties and denies any chest pain or shortness-of-breath or palpitations.
I would note from his outside colonoscopy the remainder of his colon was, otherwise, negative.  They did reach the cecum and note identification of the appendiceal orifice as well as the ileocecal valve.  Colon preparation was described as excellent.
