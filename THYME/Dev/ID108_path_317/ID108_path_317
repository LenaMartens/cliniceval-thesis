Final Diagnosis
A.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis.

B.  Liver, segment VII, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary forming a 2.5 x 1.9 x 1.7 cm mass 1.2 cm from the surgical margin.

C.  Liver, segment V, excision:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary forming a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm mass 0.6 cm from the surgical margin.

D.  Presacral region, biopsy:  Involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

E.  Presacral tissue, margin #1, biopsy:  Involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

F.  Presacral tissue, margin #2, biopsy:  Involved by grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.

G.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.3 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm) located in the rectum, 4.2 cm from the distal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.   A second mass is also identified, 4.5 cm proximal to the ulcerated tumor in the rectum, that forms a 2.6 x 2.1 x 2.0 cm firm tumor in the bowel wall (with normal overlying mucosa) that extends to involve the adventitial radial margin.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in a single (1 of 15) regional lymph node.

H.  Sacral margin, deep, biopsy:  Negative for malignancy.

I.  Sacral margin, deep #2, biopsy:  Negative for malignancy.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of sigmoid and portion of rectum"" is a rectosigmoid specimen consisting of 23.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 2.3 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm ulcerative mass is present 4.2 cm from the mucosal margin, and 1.6 cm from the radial margin.  Tumor perforation is not present.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  A 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm polyp is also identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PATTERSON.

H.  Received fresh labeled ""deep sacral margin"" is a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm portion of red-tan partially cauterized tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by CORMIER.

I.  Received fresh labeled ""deep sacral margin #2"" is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm portion of partially cauterized red-tan tissue without orientation.  Margin submitted.  Grossed by CORMIER.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. A. Sanders, k-ras & BRAF mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded metastatic liver tissue (block B2) consistent with colorectal primary.  Upon completion, results will be available in RNXL StfuAdgi. 


Internal Comments
3/2/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for k-ras & BRAF mutation analysis at request of Dr. A. Sanders/williams
