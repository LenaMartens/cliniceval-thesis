Final Diagnosis
A.  Left kidney & ureter, bladder dome, sigmoid & portion of rectum, portion of vagina, en bloc resection:  Metastatic grade 3 (of 4) colonic adenocarcinoma, forming a dominant 5.3 x 4.2 x 3.5 cm extensively necrotic mass (s/p neoadjuvant therapy) in the perirectal soft tissue, encasing the distal ureter and invading into the bladder wall.  A separate mass (1.7 cm) of metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma is present with the bowel wall, 7.0 cm from the nearest mucosal margin.  This smaller mass does not involve the mucosa.  The kidney is atrophic with extensive glomerulosclerosis and hydronephrosis.  The vaginal wall is uninvolved.  The lateral pelvic wall and bladder margins are positive for tumor. 

B.  Left pelvic sidewall, lateral margin No. 1, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

C.  Bladder margin, biopsy:  Focally involved by adenocarcinoma.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
