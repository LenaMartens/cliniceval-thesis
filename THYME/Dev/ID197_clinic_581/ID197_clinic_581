#1 Resected T4, N2 rectal adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Hauser service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Hoffman, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
Mr. Hargrove has decided to return in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation.  To this end, I have ordered a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, comprehensive lab panel including a CEA, and an appointment with us in Medical Oncology as well as a postoperative evaluation with Dr. Mccloud.  He does plan on visiting with a local medical oncologist after our appointment, and I have encouraged him to set-up an appointment to help ensure continuity of care.  He verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.  All questions were answered.

Reverend Hargrove is a very pleasant 63-year-old male from Virginia.  He has a history significant for prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy with 109 radiation seeds as well as external-beam radiation for a total dose of 4500 cGy in 1998, currently NED.
1.  July 2010 - developed rectal pain and pressure.  Evaluated locally with a colonoscopy identifying a rectal mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
2.  July 26, 2010 - CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a 6-cm indeterminate left lower lung base as well as a few small indeterminate mediastinal lymph nodes and the known rectal cancer.  No other evidence of distant disease.  Recommendations included followup imaging.
3.  August 6, 2010 - evaluated by Dr. Mccloud and taken for an APR with end colostomy and intraoperative suprapelvic tube placement.  Surgical pathology identified a 5.5-cm x 5.0-cm x 1.3-cm rectal mass invading the fibroadipose tissue and prostate.  There were negative surgical margins, and 10 of 23 regional lymph nodes were involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The posterior bladder and seminal vesicle re-excision area was also involved by poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma in the soft-tissue and prostatic tissue with extensive lymphovascular invasion.
Mr. Hargrove is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
