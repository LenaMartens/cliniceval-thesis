IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1  Stage IV (ypT3, N1, M1) adenocarcinoma with metastases to liver status-post five cycles of FOLFOX and Avastin and surgical resection
Mrs. Fudge has had a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is noted both on CT-scan as well as the postoperative pathology specimen.  However, given her extensive stage IV disease as well as this concerning positive margin on pathology, I did reiterate to her and her family that there is a high-risk of recurrence in this setting.
Thus, we would recommend continuation of her chemotherapy in the postoperative setting.  We discussed that our goal would be for seven more cycles of FOLFOX therapy for a total of 12 cycles.  We also discussed that we typically resume therapy 4-6 weeks following surgery, but the exact timing and nature of her treatment would be dependent on her postoperative recovery.  To this end, we suggested that she see her local oncologist, Dr. Estabrook, in approximately three-to-four weeks to discuss the suitability for proceeding with treatment.
We would recommend continuing Avastin if she has no postoperative complications, as this did most likely have a role in her preoperative treatment effect.  She also may require a dose reduction of either the 5-FU or oxaliplatin based on her toxicities during the upcoming cycles.
Mrs. Fudge and her family had informed questions answered.  At this time, they will plan on seeing Dr. Estabrook, and we will not schedule a followup here at EHC from a medical oncology perspective.  I did emphasize that if she did want to return to Saint Charles Parish Clinic West for either scans or a surveillance visit, we would be happy to do so, and she should contact us to make this appointment.
Thank-you very much for involving us in Mrs. Fudge's care.  Please feel free to contact us with questions or concerns via the Medical Oncology Consult Service pager (647-206-53296).

Mrs. Fudge is a very pleasant 46-year-old female with a past oncologic history well-outlined in previous notes by Dr. Jackie Thomas.  In brief, her oncologic history is as follows.
1.  January through April 2009 intermittent episodes of rectal bleeding.
2.  April 2010 colonoscopy reveals mass in the sigmoid colon with a biopsy confirming invasive adenocarcinoma.  CT scans at this time revealed evidence of extensive metastatic disease burden of the liver.  EGD at this time was negative.  CEA was elevated to over 200.
3.  May 2010 referred to EHC for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  At this time, further testing included a CEA of 508.  A repeat colonoscopy was also performed, and KRAS testing on repeat biopsy revealed mutant status.  After a consultation with Colorectal Surgery and General Surgery, it was decided to employ chemotherapy in an effort to convert her disease to a resectable status.
4.  May through July 2010 Mrs. Fudge received FOLFOX plus Avastin.  She received a total of five cycles of FOLFOX with the final four in concert with Avastin.  Her last chemotherapy treatment was in late July 2010.  She had some issues with myelosuppression, most notably thrombocytopenia during this regimen.  She has had only mild neuropathy symptoms which have not persisted throughout any cycle and are not currently present.
Mrs. Fudge underwent an en bloc extended left hepatectomy and left hemicolectomy with descending colorectostomy under the care of Drs. Fuller and Sheppard and their teams on September 2, 2010.  She is currently convalescing in the hospital.  Pathology review of this specimen revealed a focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma in segment 6 of the liver which was completely excised as well as ten foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the en bloc resection ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.8-cm with extensive therapeutic changes.  There was one mass which did grossly extend to the resection margin.  The sigmoid specimen revealed grade 2/4 poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma forming two foci as well as another focus for residual invasive adenocarcinoma within the pericolonic adipose tissue.  One of 58 regional lymph nodes was positive. Post neoadjuvant surgical staging revealed a stage of ypT3, N1, M1.
Mrs. Fudge states that she is feeling generally well, although she does have some persistent abdominal pain which can lead to nausea on occasion.  She has passed flatus but no bowel movements at this time, and she remains on a clear-liquid diet.
