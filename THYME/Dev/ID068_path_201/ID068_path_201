Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 4.4 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm exophytic mass in the sigmoid.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (13) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  Rectal mucosa with therapy effect and an intact anastomotic line.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
