Final Diagnosis
A.  Soft tissue, abdominal wall, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Terry C. Smith, M.D.

B.  Peritoneum, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Terry C. Smith, M.D.

C.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Reactive changes and fat necrosis, negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Terry C. Smith, M.D.

D.  Small bowel, ileostomy, excision:  Ileostomy site with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Terry C. Smith, M.D.

E.  Cecum and distal ileum, resection:  Normal ileal and colonic mucosa.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Terry C. Smith, M.D.

F.  Uterus and vagina, resection:  Mucinous adenocarcinoma with marked therapy effect involving the vagina and cervical wall.  The endometrium shows cystic atrophy.  There are multiple (10) intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension in the myometrium.

G.  Rectum, partial resection:  Recurrent mucinous adenocarcinoma with therapy effect.

H.  Vagina, anterior margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

I.  Vagina, posterior margin, biopsy  Positive for mucinous adenocarcinoma.

J.  Peritoneum, right pelvic sidewall margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

K.  Vaginal wall, left posterior margin and anterior rectal margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

L.  Vaginal wall, right posterior and anterior rectal margin, biopsy:  Positive for mucinous adenocarcinoma.

M.  Small bowel, resection:  Small bowel with fibrous adhesions and chronic inflammation.  Fibrovascular tissue and scar present.

N.  Vagina, new margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

O.  Rectum, posterior margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
