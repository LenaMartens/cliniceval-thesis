Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated, annular mass (6.0 x 5.0 x 0.7 cm), situated 3.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve the pericolonic adipose tissue and the serosa in the region of the perforation. No definite angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The proximal and distal resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (2 of 13) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material, [AJCC pT4b N1b] (7th edition, 2010).

	Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Freida R. Lupo, M.D.

B.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm sessile polypoid mass involving the fundus.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscular layer to focally involve the perimuscular connective tissue.  No definite angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion are identified.  Adenoma with high grade dysplasia is present in the adjacent mucosa.  Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis are also present containing multiple (3) pigmented stones (ranging in size from 2.0 to 3.2 cm in greatest dimension).  All surgical resection margins, including the cystic duct margin, are negative for dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.  A single (1) pericystic duct lymph node is negative for tumor. 

With available surgical material [AJCC pT2 N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid and rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 32.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 6.0 x 5.0 x 0.7 cm ulcerative annular mass is present within the sigmoid, 3.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 4.2 cm from the radial margin.  The specimen is a perforation in the anterior wall underlying the tumor.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MARLOW.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 10.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm gallbladder with a 1.0 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  There is a  2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm sessile polypoid mass in the fundus.  There are multiple (3) pigmented stones ranging from 2.0 cm to 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by COE
