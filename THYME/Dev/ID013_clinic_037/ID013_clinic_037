#1 Metachronous colon cancer
This is her third colon cancer now, and I suspect that she may have microsatellite instability despite her advanced age and would like her tumor tested for microsatellite instability as it has not been done so that we can counsel her family members.  We discussed many different options including repeat endoscopy to see if this could be removed with endoscopic techniques.  We discussed small segmental excision.  We discussed the cancer operation that would remove the rest of her remaining colon and all of her lymph nodes followed either by an ileorectostomy or an ileostomy.  She will be seeing the stoma therapist today to discuss these things, and if she is interested in a less invasive approach, we will have her seen by our complex endoscopist for consideration of local excision.  If they are not successful or it is too risky, we will ask them to tattoo the region for consideration of surgical resection.  She and the family are agreeable to this plan.  We will coordinate this as she would like.
The tumor was not amendable to resection endoscopically.
We discussed the options again in terms of resection versus observation.  She will let us know what she would like to do and we will proceed as she wishes.  All questions answered.  Many family members were in the office.

Mrs. Hollingsworth is an 89-year-old female who was well-known to Dr Sullins from previous surgery.  Dr. Sullins performed a right hemicolectomy for colon cancer and then repeat colectomy for recurrence in the transverse colon.  She has done well for the last several years but recently developed diarrhea and had a colonoscopy to assess for the cause of the diarrhea.  She was found to have a plaque-like lesion in her sigmoid colon which was biopsied and shown to be adenocarcinoma.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not suggest any metastatic disease, and she has a normal chest x-ray.
Dr Sullins asked Mrs. Hollingsworth how her bowel function was.  She claims that her bowel function is overall good, though she does have episodes of incontinence and urgency.
