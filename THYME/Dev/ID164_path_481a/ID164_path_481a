Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, No. 1, biopsy:  Polypoid low grade dysplasia.

B.  Rectum, No. 2, biopsy:  Low grade dysplasia with focal  high grade dysplasia.

C.  Rectum, No. 3, biopsy:  Polypoid low grade dysplasia.

D.  Colon, total abdominal colectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming 2 separate masses.  One tumor measures 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm and is  located 5.0 cm from the terminal ileum margin.  The other tumor measures 6.0 x 5.2 x 1.2 cm and is located in the transverse colon.  Both tumors invade through the bowel wall.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Four (of 37) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma.

The non-neoplastic colon shows Chronic ulcerative colitis, mildly to moderately active, involving the entire colon and sparing the ileum.  Grossly, the specimen shows continuous involvement from the rectum proximally with marked mucosal atrophy.  No skip areas are identified.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2] (7th edition, 2009).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectal biopsy #1"" is a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm pink soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by DANIEL.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""rectal biopsy #2"" is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tan soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by DANIEL.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""rectal biopsy #3"" is a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tan soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by DANIEL.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon"" is a total abdominal colectomy specimen consisting of 4.0 cm in length portion of ileum, 65.0 cm in length colon, and a no appendix.  A 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm ulcerated annular mass is present involving the entire ileocecal valve that grossly invades into the fat located 5.0 cm from the terminal ileum margin.  There is an additional 6.0 x 5.2 x 1.2 cm annular infiltrative mass within the transverse colon that grossly invades into the fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LARSON.
