#1 Resected recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Patrick Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Harrison and Dr. Rodriguez, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I will ask Dr. Rodriguez to see Ms. Kent prior to hospital dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  She does have a prior history of significant vasospasm accompanying infusional 5-FU.  Please see Dr. Bourgeois note for full plan of care.  At this point, I will not make follow-up appointments for Ms. Kent to return as she has a local medical oncologist she wishes to follow-up with.  Certainly, if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to help facilitate care.

I have been asked by Dr. Patrick Service to visit with Ms. Kent for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mrs. Kent is a very pleasant 62-year-old from Oklahoma City.
PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  August 27, 2008--anemic, and biopsy of a rectal mass revealed adenocarcinoma.
2.  September 24, 2008--T3, N1 mucinous adenocarcinoma with 3 (of 15) nodes involved.  The tumor diameter was 5-cm, and margins were negative.  Postop, she had an anastomotic leak and peritonitis which delayed adjuvant therapy nearly three-months.
3.  December 26, 2008, to January 20, 2009--radiation therapy of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions.  Patient states she did not receive 5-FU or Xeloda with this.  This was followed by FOLFOX chemotherapy.  This caused vasospasm associated with 5-FU, and she also had neuropathy involving her feet from the oxaliplatin.  Adjuvant treatment completed in June 2009.
4.  Abdominal pain and vaginal irritation secondary to radiation therapy.  She was told that her intestines were "damaged" by radiation therapy.  She developed both vaginal and rectal discharge and was found to have a rectovaginal fistula.  She was hospitalized in August 2009 for hernia repair but then had postop problems.
5.  February 2010--PET scan showed recurrence in the pelvis but no evidence of distant metastases.  CEA had gone from 1.5 to 3.7 March 15, 2010.
6.  March 2010--patient came to River Falls Veterinary Hospital and was seen by Dr. Elvira Wegman on March 16.  She had a small-bowel obstruction and went to the operating room and had an end-ileostomy with a mucous fistula.  There was a defect in the cavity of the upper extent of the vagina with a mass on the rectal side.  There were loops of bowel that were obstructed in the pelvis.  These were densely adherent and radiation change.  The pelvis was not dissected.  Patient was seen by Dr. Jean Knox, who suggested neoadjuvant radiation therapy prior to consideration of resection of the pelvic mass.
7.  May 3, 2010--evaluated by Dr. Wegman, Dr. Knox, and Dr. Harrison.  Due to previous problems with severe vasospasm from infusional 5-FU, decision made to proceed with radiation treatment only, no chemotherapy given.
8.  May 5, 2010, to May 25, 2010--external-beam radiation treatments given of 3000 cGy and 20 fractions.
9.  May 26, 2010-- taken for surgical resection by Dr. Wegman and team for a complex resection of the uterus, vagina, rectum, pelvic tumor, portion of the cecum, terminal ileum, and distal ileum, cystoscopy, interoperative radiation treatments, bilateral external ureteral catheter placement, right inferiorly based pedicled omentum to fill the irradiated pelvis, takedown ileostomy, ileocolostomy.  Per operative note, no evidence of distant disease. Surgical pathology from the uterus and vagina resection noting mucinous adenocarcinoma with marked therapy effect involving the vagina and cervical wall.  Partial rectal resection also showing recurrent mucinous adenocarcinoma with therapy effect.  Multiple peritoneal abdominal wall omental biopsies negative.  All gross tumor resected.
Mrs. Kent has continued to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during consultation today.
