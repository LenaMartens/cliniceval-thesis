#1 Nodular, friable, bleeding area in colon between 18- and 20-cm worrisome for malignancy with high-grade dysplasia on biopsies
I talked with Dr. Rivera who will see the patient and perform enemas and sigmoidoscopy to view this himself.  Dr. Howard did not think it was likely this could be removed endoscopically, but Dr. Rivera will take a look at this.  It is likely she will need surgery for this.  She has had some recent blood tests in the last couple weeks, and she also had an electrocardiogram that was unremarkable April 14, 2010.  I think she is fit for surgery if she needs surgery, and she will see Dr. Wilkinson back at some point for her musculoskeletal problems.  I will be in touch either through the patient or through Dr. Rivera in followup in terms of whether she goes to surgery or whether he feels this might be something that might be amenable to endoscopic removal, but from talking with Dr. Howard it sounds like it probably is not endoscopically removable, and she will probably need an operation.  She is in good shape for this.

Colonic dysplasia and abnormal colonoscopy.

[end section id="20102"]

I saw the patient, examined the patient, answered her questions.
This is a most pleasant 69-year-old woman who visited Montezuma Medical Center for the first-time April 14 for a general medical exam.  She tells me she had a colonoscopy back in the 1980s, she does not really recall what they found but it was okay.  Her sister recently died of ovarian cancer.  There is family history on grandmother and the father's side of ovarian cancer, brother melanoma, father lung cancer who smoked.  No colon cancer.  The patient had an evaluation here which included a normal CBC, vitamin D, electrolytes, calcium, liver function tests, creatinine, TSH and had a urologic exam for some red cells in her urine that turned out to be uneventful but she had a colonoscopy.  I talked with Dr. Howard who performed, and between 18- and 20-cm from the anus at a bend of the rectosigmoid which seems to me a little further in the rectosigmoid, but he described it as rectosigmoid, there was a 50 to 60% of the circumference flat, nodular, friable, bleeding area that he did not think was removable and did biopsies.  This shows tubular adenoma tissue with high-grade dysplasia.  A diminutive 3-mm polyp in the ascending colon was removed and was a typical low-grade tubular adenoma.  The patient has no symptoms.  She has not had any bleeding.  In 1983, she had a hysterectomy with scar ovaries removed for benign tumors and appendix removed at the same time.  Five years later through the inside she had a bladder tie-up surgery in 1988.  She has had three vaginal deliveries.  No Cesarean sections.  She had a stress test because of some vague chest discomfort in 2008, and standard exercise treadmill Bruce protocol slightly less than 7 minutes.  No ST-segment changes, no anginal symptoms.  She has no history of heart, lung, liver, kidney disease and has been quite healthy except for musculoskeletal complaints.  She is on Diovan, simvastatin, vitamin, fish oil, and aloe vera which is loratadine.

Extremities:  No edema.  She has on her left leg just below the kneecap an area that poufs out that she did not notice before that feels to me like a lipoma or perhaps a soft cyst.  It is quite soft and deformable.  She said her father had a lot of lipomas.  She has had some what she calls sciatica pain in her left hip and side recently going down her leg.Lungs:  Chest clear to auscultation.Abdomen:  Soft, slightly obese, nontender without mass, fluid, bruit or lesion.ENT:  Mucous membranes of the mouth moist without abnormality.Heart:  S1, S2 benign.  No murmur, rub or gallop.General:  Alert, healthy.Lymph:  No supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
