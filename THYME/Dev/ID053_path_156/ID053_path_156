Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph nodes, para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:  Negative for tumor.  Marked treatment effect.

B.  Terminal ileum, total abdominal colon, and rectum; total proctocolectomy:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is identified forming an indurated area (7.0 x 4.0 cm) located in the sigmoid colon, 15.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin, arising in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis.  Multiple (340) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia present throughout the colon.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat, with approximately 70 percent of the tumor viable (s/p neoadjuvant therapy).  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  Multiple (10 of 17)) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma, with 3 demonstrating treatment effect.  A peritumoral nodule (5.0 x 4.8 x 3.5 cm) encases the inferior mesenteric artery, and demonstrates widespread soft tissue and perineural invasion.  All surgical margins are negative for tumor.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration.

C.  Bowel, mucosa, biopsy:  Benign anorectal mucosa.

D.  Lymph nodes, iliac, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (2) lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

E.  Lymph nodes, para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:  A single lymph node involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""para-aortic lymph node"" is a 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm lymph node.  All submitted.  Grossed by DEMOSS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, total abdominal colon, and rectum"" is a total colectomy consisting of a 17.0 cm terminal ileum in continuity with a 147.0 cm in length of colon with a 9.0 x 1.0 cm appendix.  On opening, the mucosa displays multiple (340) polyps, a congested cecum, and a 7.0 x 40 cm indurated area in the sigmoid colon.  The indurated area comes to within 15.0 cm of the distal margin.  There is a 5.0 x 4.8 x 3.5 cm markedly firm mass in the mesentery of the sigmoid colon, encasing the IMA, which on sectioning reveals a tan yellow cut surface.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached pericolonic tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DEMOSS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""bowel mucosa"" are four fragments of mucosal tissue (ranging in size from 2.0 cm to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension).  No polyps seen grossly.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CISNEROS.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""iliac nodes"" is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by CISNEROS.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""para-aortic lymph node"" is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by CISNEROS.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Lymph nodes, para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:  Negative for tumor.  Marked treatment effect.

B.  Terminal ileum, total abdominal colon, and rectum; total proctocolectomy:  Invasive adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated.  Multiple (greater than 300) polyps are identified in the colon.  Hold over to evaluate tumor, polyps,  and lymph nodes on permanent sections.

Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by: Robin T. Tristan, M.D.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jesse Martin, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon adenocarcinoma tissue (block B2).  Upon completion, results will be available in SJFF SesuBfst.
