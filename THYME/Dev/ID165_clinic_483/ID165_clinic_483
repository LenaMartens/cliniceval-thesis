#1 Metastatic colon cancer
I agree with Sheila Paulson's well-outlined recommendations, assessment, and treatment plan.  Mrs. Fudge will have a colonoscopy because of this thickening seen on the right-side of the colon which is difficult to explain this stool.  I discussed this with the Kwan and explained also that with her having young-onset colon cancer, she does have a high-risk of having Lynch syndrome which sometimes can present with two malignancies.  I think knowing the status of the cancer will be important to determine if surgery would be indicated.  She will be seen in  medical oncology to discuss chemotherapy options.  She will also be seen by Dr. Fuller and Dr. Sheppard to discuss options for treatment of her metastatic colon cancer.  Will obtain immunostaining to evaluate for mismatch repair and also possibly microsatellite instability.

Mrs. Fudge is a 46-year-old woman who was just found on April 20 to have metastatic colon cancer.  She had been having some nausea and pain in the right upper quadrant and fatigue.  She noticed after taking an antibiotic for an infection in January of 2010 that she had blood in the stool.  One-time there was quite a bit of blood in the stool.  Following that she would have intermittent episodes of either dark blood or just flecks of stool.  She had a voluntary 10-pound weight-loss.  April 20, 2010, she underwent a colonoscopy, and in the sigmoid colon there was found to be a 5- to 6-cm mass that was biopsy-proven to be cancer.  Near this there were several polyps that were left in place.  There was also a-1.2-cm sigmoid tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia removed.  Melanosis coli was noted.  Her CEA was 224.  Chest x-ray was negative, but CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed liver lesions throughout the liver, and at least nine of these were detected.  In the ascending colon there was noted to be thickening of the wall of the colon.  She has a family history of her brother having had melanoma at age 46, another brother had a polyp.  Mother had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 84.  One maternal uncle had prostate cancer in his 60s, and two of his sons had cancer, one in age 50s in the liver, and another son had, perhaps, colon cancer in his 50s.  A maternal aunt had colon cancer in her 60s.  Her father had a stroke at age 42 and lived to be in his 80s.  One paternal aunt had colorectal cancer in her 50s.
