#1 Stage III colon adenocarcinoma, status-post resection on April 16, 2010
#2 History of nerve damage to the right rib region
#3 History of tarsal tunnel syndrome
I discussed with Ms. Tilley that we would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy to decrease risk of recurrence.  We did discuss FOLFOX regimen, and we would not recommend this with robust, given that the oxaliplatin would likely exacerbate her neuropathy symptoms.  We would therefore recommend that she receive capecitabine as adjuvant therapy.  I discussed the differences in predicted overall survival between FOLFOX and capecitabine.  Ms. Tilley in agreement with this plan.
I would also like to have Dr. Moore's team look at her wound at this point in time to determine if we need another week for her to heal prior to starting chemotherapy.  I have given her a supplemental drug sheet on capecitabine.
As for the pulmonary nodule, we will further evaluate that with a chest CT-scan and then we will meet back tomorrow to discuss results of the scan as well as discuss the appropriate time to initiate chemotherapy, likely within the next one-to-two weeks.  All questions were answered.
This case was discussed with Dr. Kuster who is in agreement with the above assessment and plan.

Ms. Tilley is a pleasant 76-year-old female from Valley Stream who presents with the following oncologic history:
1.  March 2010 complained of abdominal pain for a month as well as rust-colored stools.
2.  April 1, 2010, colonoscopy was performed identifying a splenic flexure mass. Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  April 2, 2010, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for distant metastasis.  Chest x-ray was negative.
4.  April 16, 2010, taken by Dr. Moore for a segmental resection of the transverse colon.  Per the operative note, there was no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology from the transverse colon identified a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.8-cm x 3.5-cm x 0.7-cm mass in the transverse colon invading through the muscularis propria with lymphatic and vascular invasion, and 1 of 16 regional lymph nodes was involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Also, there was a separate 3.2-cm x 2.5-cm x 2.2-cm nodule present in the mesentery separate from the mucosal tumor.  There were negative surgical margins.
Mrs. Tilley presents to the Church Square Family Clinic for consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy for a stage III colon adenocarcinoma.  She has recovered well from surgery, although she is still trying to pack the wound at the umbilicus.  She has not had any exudate of drainage or blood from the wound.  She denies any fevers or chills.  She has lost about 20 pounds since April but has regained about 3 pounds over the past one-to-two weeks.  She has soft formed stools which no longer have the rust color.  She otherwise denies cardiac, respiratory, or genitourinary symptoms.  Denies any hematochezia for melena.
