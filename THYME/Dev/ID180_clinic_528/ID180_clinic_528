I saw and evaluated the patient on clinical rounds with Dr. Nick Holley. I agree with the findings and the plan of care as documented in Dr. Holley' note from July 1, 2010.

In summary, Mrs. Metcalf is a 78-year-old lady who presented with left quadrant pain in April this year leading to a detection of a mass in the ascending colon which has subsequently been resected in June 2010. The final staging is pending, but it appears to be at least a pathological T4 with a lymph node status pending evaluation from the surgery performed on 29 June 2010.
We hope to get this organized and also to compare her equivocal multiple pulmonary nodules with a scan that is awaited for comparison sake from the Green Hospital. Once we have this data together, further recommendations of systemic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting will be presented to her. She understands the plan; so does her son who was present during our meeting.
