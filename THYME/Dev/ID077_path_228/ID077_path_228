Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid and rectum with anastomosis, resection:  Recurrent grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 2.3 x 1.9 x 0.5 cm ulcerative mass arising at the prior anastomosis site.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic soft tissue.  Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.  The margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (5) regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
