Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Adams Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Townsend, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
PATIENT EDUCATION:
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Mr. Evans Juarez is a pleasant 61-year-old gentleman from Junction.  We are asked by Dr. Adams Surgical Service to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a node-negative rectal adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Juarez's history is as follows:
1.  March 22, 2010: Underwent colonoscopy for cecum due to a three-week history of hematochezia and a one-year history of intermittent left lower quadrant pain.  Patient was noted to have 10-cm from the anal verge a 3-4-cm mass that was biopsy positive for tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and a foci of intramucosal carcinoma.  Subsequent CT-scan noting an indeterminate 1.2-cm lesion in the left hepatic lobe is suspicious for a cyst.
2.  March 24, 2010: MRI scan performed of the abdomen noting that the lesion in the liver appeared cystic.  Reports that there were a few other areas on the liver that appeared to be cysts.
3.  April 2, 2010: Presented to Mountain View Medical Center where an EUS was performed noting an ulcerated friable lesion 10-12-cm from the anal verge.  By EUS was lymph node-negative.  Staged as a T2, N0.  Proctoscopy performed by Dr. Yarbrough stated that the tumor was in mid to upper rectum.
4.  April 6, 2010: Dr. Yarbrough performed a low-anterior resection.  Pathology is positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated polypoid mass located in the rectum.  Distal mucosal margin is noted to be 0.9-cm.  Remaining margins are negative.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria.  Of 25 regional lymph nodes removed, all are negative for tumor (pT3, N1).
Today Mr. Juarez is two days postoperative.  He is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.
