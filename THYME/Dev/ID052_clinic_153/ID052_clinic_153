PLAN OF CARE
We will follow troponins, which are at present mildly elevated; likely partially rate-related.  We will discuss with primary service.  We will proceed with non-ST-MI treatment measures within the guidelines of the primary service's recommendations.  Additionally, we will proceed with FAST HUG and all routine ICU prophylaxis.  Patient will be rate-controlled.  Patient would likely benefit from beta-blockade in this context, as tolerated.

I had the privilege of reviewing, examining, discussing Mr. Keith's case in room 625, Zcfmpfikj 24-3, Medical Intensive Care Unit with Dr. Cameron Parkey (532-0962) and the CCS Team and I agree with their notes of March 12, 2010, for history, findings, and plans.

Mr. Keith is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted status-post right hemicolectomy, which he underwent three days ago under the care of Dr. Montoya, Colorectal Surgical Service; who is transferred to us this evening because of supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in 1994 for coronary artery disease and had a bare metal stent placed in the first obtuse marginal branch of his left anterior descending coronary artery in January of 2010.  The patient has been known to have left bundle-branch block for some time but was discovered to have a rapid pulse rate of 130 on complaining of palpitations and shortness-of-breath.  The patient has a severely enlarged left atrium on prior echo of January 12, 2010, with a volume index of 45 cu cm/m2 at that time.  The patient also had evidence at that time of hypokinesis and akinesis in the predominant in the distribution of the posterior descending coronary artery.  Since admission to the intensive care unit, the patient has been hemodynamically stable.
