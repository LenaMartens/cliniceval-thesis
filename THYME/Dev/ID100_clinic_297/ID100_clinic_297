Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Jamie Brooks's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Ashley Herrera, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.  Patient is planning to return to his local oncologist for which he has a good relationship with.  I did review with him that typically would recommend approximately four months worth of adjuvant therapy.   Please refer to Dr. Herrera subsequent supervisory note as to the recommended regimens.

Mr. Colgan is a pleasant 55 year-old gentleman from Saddle River New Jersey.  We are seeing him at the request of Dr. Brooks's surgical service to discuss treatment recommendations for an individual who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and followed subsequently with APR, node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma.  His history is as follows.
1.  November 16, 2009 - Due to bright-red blood per rectum, had his first ever complete colonoscopy which noted a mass 2-9-cm above the anal verge.  Biopsy of this was positive for invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  EUS testing performed at that time noting the lesion to be T3, N0.  CEA at this time was 1.9.
2.  November 17, 2009 - CT abdomen and pelvis performed at-home was negative for evidence of metastatic disease and did identify cysts in the liver and in the kidneys.  The rectal mass itself appeared on the right lateral wall of the rectum with a focal bulge of soft-tissue along the right lateral wall, possibly tumor extension.  Nonspecific lymph node in the right internal iliac.
3.  January 20, 2010 - Completed five weeks of chemoradiation therapy.  He was treated with Xeloda without any complications.
4.  January 21, 2010 - MRI of the abdomen noting that the right kidney had a typical cyst.  Again, there was cleft-like atrophy in the upper pole of the left kidney which appeared to be fibrotic.  Again, documenting the mass in the rectum wall that appeared to be bulging along the right lateral wall.
5.  February 22, 2010 - Underwent repeat colonoscopy which stated that the previously identified lesion had decreased in size by approximately 25%.
6.  March 1, 2010 - Presented to Dakota Medical Plaza for consideration of surgical resection.  CT-scan performed at this time stated that the known rectal carcinoma was difficult to see without evidence of any lymphadenopathy.  Again, identified were cysts in the liver and the kidney.
7.   March 3, 2010.  Dr. Brooks performed APR.  Pathology positive for invasive grade 3  (of 4) adenocarcinoma with minimal treatment effect.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria. Multiple (5 of 14) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. [pT2N2MX]
Today, Mr. Colgan is one-day postoperative.  He is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  His wife is present during this consultation.
