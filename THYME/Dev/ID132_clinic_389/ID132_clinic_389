Surgical intervention for rectal cancer, status-post neoadjuvant treatment.

Mr. Moore is a pleasant 58-year-old gentleman from Davenport who unfortunately has a low rectal cancer.  It involved the top of the sphincter muscle and was diagnosed as a T3 lesion.  There is also a lung nodule that is likely a pulmonary metastasis.  He was treated first with preop chemotherapy and radiation.  He finished with his radiation treatment about six-weeks ago.  Restaging shows that there may be a subtle decrease in the size of the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule and interval resolution of rectal mural thickening in the rectum.
His PMH and PSH is outlined below.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Rectal cancer.  Possible pulmonary metastasis.  Dr. Jude Bhatia had seen him in Thoracic Surgery who suspected his pulmonary nodule was a metastatic lesion.  However, Dr. Bhatia believed the plan should be to continue to treat his rectal cancer with definitive surgery, and then three-to-four weeks following surgery, this should be re-evaluated, and he should be seen by Dr. Bhatia.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  On February 16, his cholesterol was 144, triglycerides 80, HDL 48, and LDL of 113.  He is on fish oil.
3.  Prior history of asthma when he was a child.  He no longer is using his inhaler and denies any respiratory symptoms.
4.  History of cardiac tamponade in November 2001.  He had a pericardial window done as he had a significant viral infection which led to the large pericardial effusion.  Percutaneous pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful, and he underwent the pericardial window.  Blood cultures were done, and no specific cause was determined.  He has been instructed in the future if he develops a severe respiratory infection to make sure a chest x-ray is obtained to make sure he does not have evidence of a pericardial effusion.  He was followed by a cardiologist following this episode with his last echocardiogram in February 2003 with an EF of 55%.  He had no significant valvular stenosis, and his right ventricle was at the upper limits of normal with a small increase in the left atrial size.  At that time his local cardiologist felt his heart status was stable and did not recommend further imaging.  He has been asymptomatic from a cardiac perspective since that time and with good exercise tolerance.  His EKG that was performed here during his initial evaluation in March revealed a ventricular rate of 63, normal sinus rhythm with a left axis deviation from March 2, 2010.  In February of 2003, I can see this was the same EKG back at that time.
5.  Elevated PSA.  He was seen by our urology colleagues in March as his PSA was 4.0 on March 2, 2010, and they were concerned about prostate cancer but felt his rectal cancer should take priority and did not recommend a biopsy at that time.  It has been recommended that following his definitive rectal cancer surgery, prior to the start of his adjuvant treatment, a PSA should be rechecked.  If this is elevated, it does not necessarily mean further intervention will be performed, but it should be re-evaluated at that time.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  He broke his ankle in the eighth grade and was casted.
2.  Pericardial window as discussed above in 2001.
3.  He had an injury and fractured his left elbow and left wrist and was casted.
4.  Power port placed in March 2010.
