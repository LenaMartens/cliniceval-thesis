#1 Resected recurrent adenocarcinoma of the rectum at the anastomosis; preoperatively, staged T3, N1, postoperative T3, N0
Prior to meeting with Mr. Epstein and his wife, I have had the opportunity to review his past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  I have also had the opportunity to review this case in its entirety with my collaborating provider, Dr. Council, who is in agreement with this plan.  Discussed with Mr. Epstein typically would recommend adjuvant therapy in such a setting due to the fact that clinically he was considered to be a stage III rectal cancer.  Therefore, discussed with him various treatment options which include FOLFOX 6, oral Xeloda, or observation.  Mr. Epstein understands that the final decision is his.  He will be having a conversation with his local oncologist as to what is the next best step.  I informed him that there is no right or wrong answer.  Understands that it is a very personal decision.  Did inform him that if the cancer did reoccur that often times we can control cancer with chemotherapies.  However, once it does reoccur, the chances of curing an individual go down significantly.  He is going to take all of this under advisement.
#2 Follow-up
Mr. Epstein and his wife will be returning home to undergo additional therapy.  They will be contacting us with the name of the oncologist they would like all this information relayed to.  We will also then arrange for a CD copy of his most recent CT-scan to be sent to that facility.  He had several questions that I answered to his satisfaction.  He denies any further questions or concerns.  I did review with him the potential toxicities of the chemotherapy regimen which could include, but are not limited to, nausea, vomiting, decreased white count, infection, elevated temperature, constipation, diarrhea, cold sensitivity, and neuropathy.

Me Epstein is a pleasant 70-year-old gentleman from Ong, NE 68452 Davey.  Seeing him today postoperatively to discuss recommendations regarding adjuvant therapy for a recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma at the anastomotic site.  For a comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated September 20, 2010.  Briefly, his history is as follows:
1.  In 2007, diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Underwent resection and radiation therapy receiving  7380 cGy.  Initiated on Lupron.
2.  In 2009, diagnosed with bladder cancer, noninvasive, high-grade urothelial carcinoma.  Has had two scrapings performed.
3.  April 28, 2009, colonoscopy performed noting a mass at 30 cm, which was positive for villous adenoma with focal, high-grade dysplasia.  Additional lesion at 10-cm positive for invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.
4.  May 13, 2009, low-anterior resection performed elsewhere.  Pathology positive for invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Of three regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for metastatic disease.  An additional adenoma with focal, high-grade dysplasia was present.  Surgical resected margins are negative (pT2, N0).
5.  July 6, 2010, colonoscopy noting ulceration at the region of the anastomosis.  Biopsies indeterminate.  Pathology reviewed  at Fond du Lac Health Center notes suspicious for invasive adenocarcinoma.
6.  July 20, 2010, proctoscopy noting a rectal mass which is biopsy positive for invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  CT performed at-home negative for metastatic disease.
8.  August 3, 2010, presented to Fond du Lac Health Center for further workup.  Chest x-ray documenting nodular opacity at the left lung base laterally.  CT-scan noting a 9-mm nodule in the left lung base suspicious for metastasis.  Perirectal lymphadenopathy as well as indeterminate soft-tissue thickening and stranding in the perirectal space identified.  Several hepatic cysts as well as small hepatic lesions that are too small to characterize.
8.  August 4, 2010, PET scan noting uptake located at the anastomosis.  Low-grade uptake of perirectal lymph node.  Liver lesions were too small for PET analysis.
9.  August 9, 2010, EUS performed noting a mass at 6-cm that was ulcerated.  Peritumoral lymph node appear suspicious,  not biopsied due to location.
10. August 18, 2010, through September 10, 2010, completed chemoradiation therapy, receiving infusional 5-FU.
11.  September 21, 2010, Dr. Mckinney performed an APR with an omentoplasty as well as interoperative radiation therapy.  Pathology of the tissue from the APR positive for adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a foreign body giant-cell reaction.  The ulcer as well as tumor were present at the anastomotic site.  Of 14 retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all were negative for metastatic disease.  Surgical resected margins were negative.
Today, Mr. Epstein states that he is feeling extremely well.  Reports his appetite is improving.  Denies any nausea or vomiting.  Weight has been stable.  Energy level is also increasing.  States that he is trying to remain as active as possible.  Reports that ostomy appliance has been working well, absent of any blood or mucus.  He has had no complications with the appliance.  He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
