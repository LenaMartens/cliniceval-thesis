I discussed her situation with several of my colleagues in GI Oncology.  She has a difficult situation in that she cannot take oxaliplatin because of prior reaction in her MS.  I did discuss the fact that she had a-positive margin and felt she did need treatment.  I would therefore suggest treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin for six-months.  She could try Xeloda, but this might be more difficult for her than 5-FU.  Erbitux and Avastin have not been shown to be effective in the adjuvant setting so I would not use these, and I think also CPT-11 might be difficult for her.

PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  2001:  Left breast lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy.  She received no postop chemotherapy.  She was given tamoxifen for five years and then Femara.
2.  July 23, 2007, right hemicolectomy for T4, N1, colon carcinoma.  The carcinoma invaded into the small-bowel; 2 of 26 nodes positive for metastatic disease.
3. Approximately August 2007-December 2007:  "19-20 sessions" of adjuvant therapy.  She originally was given FOLFOX but after two cycles of oxaliplatin, she developed a reaction, and, in addition, she has MS and could not tolerate it.  She continued treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin given twice a week.
4.  September 24, 2009:  CT-scan showed a cystic mass in the left adnexa.  This was biopsied through the bladder and was positive for metastatic disease.  October 1, 2009-November 10, 2009, she received radiation therapy of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions.  She did not receive any chemotherapy along with this.
5.  January 27, 2010, cystoscopic exam was positive for metastatic disease invading the bladder.  This was consistent with colorectal primary.  We have reviewed these slides and agree with the diagnosis.  She had a left ureteral stent placed as there was obstruction in the left ureter.  Surgery was recommended at Village Senior Residence Hospital (CC), and she sought a second opinion at Parkview Clinic in Lew Beach, and again surgery was recommended.  She was told that she might need a colostomy as well as a urostomy, and she therefore came to Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.  She was seen by Dr. Billy Jordan Esparza in April 2010 in Urology.
6.  May 17, 2010, resection of metastatic disease with removal of atrophic left kidney by Dr. Sadie Robles.  There was a-positive margin at the bladder.  Patient did not receive interop radiation therapy.
She is recovering from her surgery and overall doing well.  She has no new complaints.
