#1 Rectal cancer
Agree with Sheila Hood's well-outlined recommendation, assessment, and treatment plan.  I reviewed with Mrs. Simmons and her daughter-in-law that we need to do further staging which includes an endorectal ultrasound, colonoscopy, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT.  We will also need to do preoperative eval with an electrocardiogram and chest x-ray.  We discussed that in certain cases depending on the stage of the tumor that she could require neoadjuvant treatment, and we discussed what this might involve.   We also discussed the likelihood of a stoma, and she was already aware of this possibility.
