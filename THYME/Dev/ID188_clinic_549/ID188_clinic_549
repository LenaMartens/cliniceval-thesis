#1 Stage IIA (T3, N0, M0) adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon
I discussed with the patient that use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer is controversial. In her case, based on the clinicopathologic characteristics of her tumor, it most likely will not be needed. Results of testing of the patient's tumor for microsatellite instability are pending.  Final recommendations could be affected by this information and will be communicated to the patient by phone.  Patient will need to have a followup appointment with Medical Oncology and a baseline CT abdomen and pelvis performed in four to six-weeks.  She plans to obtain this locally in Rutherford.  I gave the patient my card and encouraged her to call us if questions arise in the interim.
