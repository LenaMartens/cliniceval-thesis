Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Adams's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Lopes, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
At this time I have visited with the White family and informed them that at this time it is unclear as to if adjuvant therapy would be offered in his situation.  Counseled them that it depends on the patient's physical status when he returns, especially due to his past medical history including renal insufficiency, diabetes, and cardiac issues.  Did visit about the two separate malignancies and shared that with just a rectal cancer, one could consider offering chemotherapy.  In regards to the gallbladder cancer, not clear as to if therapy would be offered.  Explained that because only one lymph node was removed unclear as to his risk of recurrence.  Would like the patient to return to have further discussion regarding which avenue would be best to proceed.  At the time of his return I will have him see by Dr. Fredericks, GI Oncology, and Radiation Oncology to determine what are the best treatment options.  Family had numerous questions that I answered to their satisfaction.  They have agreed to return in approximately four weeks' time to have this conversation.  Denies any further questions or concerns.  Has our telephone number to contact us should they have any further questions or concerns.

Mr. Cervantes is a pleasant 81-year-old gentleman who is being seen at the request of Dr. Coll Surgical Service to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of a node-positive sigmoid colon cancer as well as a node-negative gallbladder adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Cervantes's history is as follows:
1.  September 21, 2010: Presented to local provider due to rectal bleeding.  He was at that time found to be anemic.  He was also experiencing chronic abdominal symptoms suggestive of symptomatic cholelithiasis with biliary colic, transient jaundice, abdominal pain, and dark urine.
2.  September 27, 2010: colonoscopy performed to the cecum noting that at 20 cm from the anal verge was a diffuse friable sigmoid colon apple core lesion, biopsy positive for infiltrating grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  Also noted to have scattered diverticular disease.  CEA was noted to be elevated at 11.
3.  October 7, 2010: Presented to PCNH for further workup.  CT abdomen and pelvis noting a 4.4-cm lesion in the mid to distal sigmoid colon without evidence of adenopathy.  Also noted cholelithiasis with several small nodular thickening in the gallbladder wall, questioning polyps.  There was a 10 x 17 mm indeterminate region in the liver that was adjacent to the gallbladder fundus.
4.  October 12, 2010: Dr. Adams and Dr. Fredericks performed a low-anterior resection with mobilization of the splenic flexure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Pathology from the tissue removed for the sigmoid, colon, and rectum notes an invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerating annular mass.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscularis propria to involve the pericolonic adipose tissue and the serosa in the region of perforation.  No definite angiolymphatic invasion identified.  Proximal distal resected margins negative.  Of 13 regional lymph nodes, two were positive for metastatic disease.  Pathology from the cholecystectomy is positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a sessile polypoid mass involving the fundus.  The tumor infiltrates through the muscular layer to focally involve the perimuscular connective tissue.  Adenoma with high-grade dysplasia is present in the adjacent mucosa.  All resected margins are negative.  One pericystic duct lymph node-negative for tumor.
Sleepy.  On pain medications.  His family is present during this entire consultation.
