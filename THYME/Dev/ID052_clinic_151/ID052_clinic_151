#1 Adenomatous cecal polyp
We will proceed with a complex colonoscopy after he is cleared by Cardiology to see if this can be removed endoscopically.  I discussed with him and his wife that if this does not seem to be amenable to endoscopic removal he will likely need a right hemicolectomy.  Also, if this is able to be removed but there is evidence of a malignancy, he will also need surgery.  There is a chance, if it is able to be removed endoscopically and there is no evidence of cancer, that maybe multiple complex endoscopies can remove this completely.  He would like to attempt the complex colonoscopy route prior to jumping to surgery.  He will see Dr. Ismael Montoya in surgical consultation later this week.
#2 Coronary artery disease
As he has had dyspnea on exertion and has not had a recent cardiac evaluation, we will set-up a cardiology consultation.  Our cardiology colleagues have decided to preschedule a sestamibi scan as well as an echocardiogram.  Beforehand, we will get an updated EKG.
#3 Hyperlipidemia
I will check a lipid screen, so the cardiologist can look at this as well.
#4 Diabetes mellitus type-2
Reviewed fasting instructions with him.  We will obtain a fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c.
#5 Personal history of sigmoid cancer
I will check a CEA.
#6 Left inguinal hernia
We will consult General Surgery for an opinion.  If he requires surgery for this polyp, this would take precedence, and I discussed with the patient and his wife if this were to be the case he may have to wait six-weeks at minimum in-between the two surgeries if our general surgeons felt this was indicated.  We do have evidence of the hernia also on his outside CT-scan.
#7 Dyspnea on exertion
Discussed above.  Will have Cardiology evaluate.  This is not likely to be respiratory-related, but we will obtain a basic chest x-ray.  He has no history of tobacco use.  Likely due to cardiomyopathy and heart disease.
#8 Hypertension
Well-controlled.
#9 Questionable hemorrhoid
When Dr. Montoya sees him back, we will perform anoscopy to look in more detail at this to make sure there is not something concerning, as this is fairly new and is a little more firm than what I am used to feeling.  This does not appear to look obviously, from what I can see today, like a malignancy.
Spent 90 minutes with Dr. Keith and his wife.  I called up his hard chart and reviewed multiple records in detail.  I will plan to see him back with Dr. Montoya following his appointments including his cardiology evaluation prior to his colonoscopy, and then after his colonoscopy to see whether he will end up needing surgery for the polyp.  All questions were answered.
Code status discussed.  Dr. Keith would like to be a full code.  This was discussed in the presence of his wife.

Dr. Keith is seen for evaluation of a cecal polyp.  He also is requesting to be seen by General Surgery for a left inguinal hernia.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Dr. Keith is an 80-year-old gentleman from Newton Grove, North Carolina, who has been a patient at Marathon General Hospital previously but has not been here since 1994.  He has a history of sigmoid adenocarcinoma diagnosed here in 1989 and underwent a low-anterior resection that year by Dr. Brent Miller.  From the old records this appeared to be a T3, N1 sigmoid cancer.  One of four lymph nodes were involved, and he received a year of adjuvant chemotherapy. This had been his first colonoscopy, and he was 59 at that time.  He had no family history of colorectal cancer.  He has been undergoing surveillance colonoscopies since that time and typically has had polyps.  He returned here in 1990 and a-1-cm cecal polyp was removed.  He returned in 1991 and another 3-mm cecal polyp was removed.  He had planned on returning here for continued surveillance in 1994 but ended up having significant cardiac issues and never underwent a colonoscopy.
In 1994, Dr. Keith had problems with shortness-of-breath which developed within a month's time.  He was evaluated locally, and it was believed his echocardiogram appeared okay.  He and his wife still had  concerns regarding his cardiac status, and since he was coming to RCH to undergo a surveillance colonoscopy he was planning also to see a cardiologist.  He was found to have an estimated ejection fraction of 20%.  A prior echocardiogram from 1989 prior to his colon surgery revealed an EF of 65%.  He was hospitalized acutely, and initially it was felt he was not a surgical candidate with his significant coronary artery disease but after several days in the hospital he ended up undergoing a five-vessel bypass and was on an intra-aortic balloon pump for a time.  It was believed he had an MI at some point, but Dr. Keith reports he never had chest pain.  He has followed locally every 6 months by a cardiologist since that time, Dr. Cameron Peters, but has not had a recent updated echocardiogram or stress test. Per patient report, Dr. Peters "does not believe in stress testing for older people."
Dr. Keith and his wife have some concerns that he has not had a recent cardiac evaluation, as for the last five to six years he has been noticing dyspnea on exertion.  On a scale of 0 to 10, if he had to rate how much of a problem this is for him, this rates typically a-1, but it is concerning for Dr. Keith.  He does not exercise regularly because he has noticed problems with his left inguinal hernia when he uses the elliptical machine or bike. He is able to go up four flights of stairs but gets significantly short of breath.  He feels his activity tolerance has decreased quite a bit over the last several years.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He has no history of smoking.  There was some question of whether he had a pleural effusion on his outside CT-scan performed on November 9, 2009, but per our review there was no mention of a pleural effusion, just evidence of fibrosis in the left lung base.  He denies recent fevers or chills or other respiratory symptoms, including hemoptysis or chronic coughing.
In regard to his bowel habits he typically moves his bowels once-a-day and denies fecal incontinence.  No hematochezia.  He rarely has problems with constipation.  He is not on medication for his bowels.  His most recent colonoscopy was performed on November 2, 2009, done for surveillance, as it has been two-and-a-half years since his prior colonoscopy, and a 3-cm sessile mass was noted adjacent to the ileocecal valve.  There was a prior tattoo noted around that area from a history of prior cecal polyps.  Biopsies were obtained and have been reviewed here and are consistent with a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  He also had two 4-mm ascending colon polyps that were removed and consistent with tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia.  He had a single sigmoid diverticulum.  He has been referred for definitive treatment of this polyp.  He is hoping to avoid surgery and hoping this can be removed via complex endoscopy. A CT-scan of the abdomen/pelvis performed locally on November 9, 2009, was in follow-up to his colonoscopy finding.  We reviewed these images, revealing a 2.7-cm irregular fatty mass adjacent to the ileocecal valve.  He was noted to have bilateral inguinal hernias with the left hernia containing fat and a loop of nonobstructing sigmoid colon.  There was no evidence of anything appearing concerning for metastatic disease.
In regard to his left inguinal hernia, he has had this for quite a few years. It bothers him when he is lifting his grandchildren or when he stands for a while.  He can reduce this by lying down.  He notices the bulging.  He had a right inguinal hernia repair in the 1970s without mesh.  The biggest issue regarding his hernia is it is that it limits his ability to exercise.  He can only use the elliptical machine for four to five minutes, and then the hernia bothers him, and he will not be able to do anymore.  He and his wife would like an opinion by our general surgeons here and are likely interested in surgery if this is indicated. They understand the polyp takes precedence in having surgery if it is unable to be removed via complex colonoscopy or if this is found to be a cancer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Sigmoid colon cancer.  Discussed above, no evidence of recurrence.
2. Diabetes mellitus, type-2.  He was diagnosed in approximately 1955.  He has been on insulin for several years now.  He believes his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7 in October.  His local provider's goal is to have this under 6.  He has problems with hypoglycemia at times, and last evening reported his blood sugar was only 66, and he did not take his Lantus and has not taken insulin yet this morning.  He usually is symptomatic and can feel when he is getting low and is able to correct it and has not had a serious hypoglycemic reaction.  He is not known to have neuropathy or nephropathy but is known to have retinopathy and is followed by an ophthalmologist.
3. Left inguinal hernia.  Discussed above.
4. Coronary artery disease.  This is partially discussed above.  Underwent five-vessel CABG here in 1994.  He has what seems to be significant cardiomyopathy related to his ischemic disease, as it is suspected he had a MI before 1994.  His ejection fraction by the echo, as discussed above, was only 20% prior to his CABG surgery.  He has not had a recent evaluation.  He denies chest pain, palpitations, has not used nitroglycerin and has never been prescribed it.  He has a family history of coronary artery disease with his son who underwent four-vessel bypass at age 45.  Dr. Keith had a carotid ultrasound performed four years ago with no significant stenosis.
5. Retinopathy that is related to his diabetes.
6. History of multiple adenomatous colon polyps.  Discussed above.
7. Hearing loss.  He spontaneously developed complete hearing loss in his right ear.  The etiology is unclear.  He also has diminished hearing and presbycusis in the left ear and wears a hearing aid intermittently in the left ear.
8. Hypertension.  He says his blood pressure is typically under good control.
9. Hyperlipidemia.  He is on Lipitor.  He has been on the 20-mg for many years and believes his cholesterol is well-controlled.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1. Tonsillectomy.
2. Vasectomy.
3. Cholecystectomy with questionable appendectomy in the 1970s.
4. Right inguinal hernia repair without mesh in 1977.
5. Lower anterior resection for sigmoid cancer, 1989, here by Dr. Brent Miller.
6. Five-vessel CABG here, 1994.
