Final Diagnosis
A.  Vas deferens, right, vasectomy:  Negative for tumor.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Cindy Allen, M.D.

B.  Seminal vesicle, right margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor. Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Cindy Allen, M.D.

C.  Lymph node, left external iliac, lymphadenectomy: Lymph node with fibrosis and necrosis.  Frozen section histologic interpretation performed by:  Cindy Allen, M.D.

D.  Prostate, anterior margin, excision:  Fibrous tissue with skeletal muscle.  No viable tumor cells identified.

E.  Rectum and anus, resection:  Microscopic focus of residual moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma present (slide E18) within fibrous tissue and associated with extensive acellular mucin pools forming a 9.2 cm mass grossly.  Margins are free of tumor.   (see comment).

F.  Lymph node, ileocolic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (2) ileocolic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

G.  Abdominal colon, right hemicolectomy:  Multiple (80) tubular adenomata with low-grade dysplasia identified.  The background colonic mucosa is unremarkable.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  Multiple (6) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Debbie Wilburn.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.




Diagnosis Comment
The acellular mucin pools observed in Part E (rectum and anus) are extensively present at the anterior rectal radial margin and extends into perianal/perirectal soft tissue.  The microanatomy of the rectum in the area of the acellular mucin pools is markedly distorted and the mural location of the microscopic focus of the adenocarcinoma is unclear.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Accurate stage classification cannot be assigned. 

Case seen in consultation with Debbie Wilburn, M.D.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled right seminal vesicles versus vas deferens is a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm luminal structure of tan tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by NEHLS.

B.  Received fresh labeled margin right seminal vesicle is a 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm portion of tan/pink tissue.  All submitted. Grossed by NEHLS.

C.  Received fresh labeled left external iliac lymph node is a 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  All lymphatic tissue submitted. Grossed by NEHLS.

D.  Received fresh labeled anterior margin, prostate is a 2.2 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm piece of pink-tan fibrous tissue.  Entirely submitted.  Grossed by LASSITER.

E.  Received fresh labeled rectum and anus is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 24.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 2.2 x 1.8 cm portion of anus. A 9.2 x 4.1 x 1.5 cm ulcerative, nearly annular mass is present within the rectum, 3.5 cm from the dentate line, 14.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin, and grossly indeterminate from the radial margin. Tumor perforation cannot be determined. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by NEHLS.

F.  Received fresh labeled ileocolic lymph nodes is a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  All lymphatic tissue submitted.  Grossed by NEAL.

G.  Received fresh labeled abdominal colon is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 60.5 cm of colon, and a 6.2 x 0.7 cm appendix.  There are approximately 80 mucosal polyps, ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 0.9 cm present throughout the colon, more concentrated distally.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by FREDERICK.
