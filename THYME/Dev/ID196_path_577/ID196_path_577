Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, abdominal perineal resection:  Adenocarcinoma, moderately (grade 3 of 4) differentiated, forming a microscopic focus (0.1 cm) in the submucosa within a 2.3 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm ulcer with granulation tissue and foreign body giant cell reaction.  The ulcer is  present at the anastomotic site, 3.5 cm from the dentate line, 7.5 cm from the anal skin margin. Associated reactive changes and fibrosis are present in the perirectal soft tissues. There is a 1.5 cm segment of attached seminal vesicle.  Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

B.  Soft tissue, right pelvic sidewall margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

C.  Soft tissue, left pelvic sidewall margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Soft tissue, sacrum margin, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled sigmoid colon, rectum, anus is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 14.0 cm in length portion of colon anastomosed to a 14.5 cm in length of rectum with a 14.0 x 3.0 cm portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked.  A 2.3 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm ulcerative mass is present at the anastomotic site, 3.5 cm from the dentate line, 7.5 cm from the anal skin margin, and 2.3 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  There are 2 ulcerated areas in the anus, ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension.  There is a 0.3 cm diverticulum at the anastomosis. There is a 1.5 cm portion of adhesed seminal vesicle.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HANSON

B.  Received fresh labeled ""right pelvic sidewall margin"" is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm portion of cauterized red tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by HANSON

C.  Received fresh labeled ""left pelvic sidewall margin"" is a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm portion of cauterized red tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by MCLACHLAN.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""posterior sacrum margin"" is a 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm portion of black cauterized tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by HANSON
