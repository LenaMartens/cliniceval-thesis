Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, polypoid mass (2.6 x 2.3 x 0.6 cm) located in the rectum, 0.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 2.0 cm from the radial margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (25) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B.  Rectum, distal ring, excision:  A 3.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm mucosal ring with indwelling sutures without gross abnormality.  Gross only.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0].

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
