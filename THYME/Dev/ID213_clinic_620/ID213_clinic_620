A 70-year-old woman with a history of a recent stroke, hypertension, diabetes, presenting for evaluation of a diagnosis of colon cancer.
IMPRESSION
#1 Colon cancer
#2 Scattered polyps throughout the ascending transverse and descending colon--histopathology unknown
#3 Large multi-cm polyp in the sigmoid colon--mass in the proximal colon
#4 Recent CVA
It appears that the adenocarcinoma is in the proximal colon.  The additional lesions are of unclear clinical significance.  It would be important to further delineate for perioperative planning.  In addition, she does have multiple medical comorbidities that does put her at a higher risk, particularly with her recent CVA for any surgical procedure.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. We will perform a colonoscopy with the request that the endoscopist treat other benign polyps and biopsy any suspicious lesions for perioperative planning: hemicolectomy versus total colectomy. She was instructed to hold her diabetic medications while fasting.
2. We will request the outside CT of her abdomen and pelvis to be reviewed here.
3. We will request outside information be sent over including if any additional studies such as CT of her head and carotid ultrasounds were performed.
4. We will refer her to our colleagues in Cardiology for a perioperative assessment and clearance.
5. We will refer her to Nicotine cessation.
6. She will be evaluated by surgeons after initial work-up is complete.
7. We will perform routine labs including chest x-ray, EKG.
8. Have her return after her initial studies including her colonoscopy have been completed.
The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kendall Miller and Rena Lundy who were in agreement.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mrs. Villalobos is a 70-year-old woman with a history of a recent stroke, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, presenting for the below concerns:
#1 Colon cancer
#2 History of iron-deficiency anemia
Over the summer, Mrs. Villalobos had noted progressive fatigue.  She is noted to have iron-deficiency anemia.  Subsequently, she underwent an upper endoscopy that showed patchy antral erythema consistent with gastritis but was otherwise unremarkable.  Gastric biopsies were negative including for H. pylori.  Small-bowel biopsies were also negative as well.  Underwent a colonoscopy at the same time, and per the report, it stated that there was a tumor cecal base, which cannot be intubated secondary to stricturing, and the mass lesion ascended into the proximal ascending colon.  When they withdrew the endoscope there were three large flat polyps spaced 10 to 15-cm apart.  That was more proximal to an unknown location based on the wording in the endoscopy report.  The endoscopist also noted small polyps in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.  In the sigmoid colon there was a large round multi-cm polyp that was suspicious for advanced adenoma or possible early malignancy, and one fold distal to this there was a small round polyp that was approximately 1-cm in diameter.  This was at roughly 25 cm from the anal verge.  This area was tattooed.  Four diminutive polyps were noted in the sigmoid.  Those were removed with snare polypectomy.  Pathology showed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma from the colonic mass and that the sigmoid polyps were hyperplastic.  She subsequently had a CT-scan that showed a long-segment lesion involving the cecum with abnormal thickening of the colonic walls and narrowing of the lumen measuring of at least 8-cm.  The liver and spleen were negative.  No evidence of metastases were noted.
Since then she has been feeling well.  Does have some constipation with her iron supplementations but denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, or worsening constipation, as she does have bowel movements once every several days.  In June she did have a stroke, which left her with increasing gait difficulties and probable cranial nerve XII palsy.  However, she has still been able to get around at-home where she lives with her husband without too much difficulty as long as she is using a four-pronged cane.
