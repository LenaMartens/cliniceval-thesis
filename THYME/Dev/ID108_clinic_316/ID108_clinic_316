Jan-27-2010 12:40:36 - Modification to IMPRESSION / REPORT / PLAN by Marv D. Coker

[end section id="20100"]

[start section id="20112"]

#1 Rectal cancer, status-post 5-FU with radiation
#2 Liver metastases
#3 8mm right paratracheal "adenopathy", mildly PET-positive per outside report and a 6-mm left upper lobe lesion, indeterminate
With updates 1/27/2010:
I discussed the case with Dr. Murray to get a sense of the right hilar lesions specifically. We saw only one right paratracheal (azygous) 8x11 mm, and no right hilar adenopathy on both the Nov and 12.24.09 CTs. I personally spoke with CT radiologist as well, who agreed with that assessment and who did not feel the paratracheal lesion needed to be biopsied unless there was moderate PET avidity 11.9.09. We're waiting for the PET read.
The left upper lobe lesion is indeterminate, but not be accessible for biopsy, though it could be resected, if necessary.  We would not need a repeat CT because this is within four weeks.
If the official PET read shows right paratracheal uptake, we must consider bronchoscopic sampling. If negative for cancer, I believe proceeding with liver and primary resection, if resectable, would be appropriate if the patient wishes -- with the idea of following the LUL lesion with resection if necessary and understanding that chance of cure remains low.  However, if he has tissue-proven mediastinal disease, I would question whether hepatic resection would be of benefit. The necessity of LAR without hepatic resection could be further discussed given that he has very few if any symptoms.
PLAN
1.  Await official radiology read of his November 9 PET.
2.  Discuss further with Dr. Seymour (I tried to reach Dr. Seymour today but was unable to as he was scrubbed in).  I will call the patient with the results, and I will also have off-the-floor with Dr. Carpenter and Dr. Seymour.
I answered the patient's questions.  They expressed understanding, appreciation, and agreement.
---------
ADDENDUM 1.27.10
Nov 9, 2009 PET shows moderate uptake in the right hilar and right paratracheal nodes, suspicious for mets, doesn't seem infectious given focality (despite presence of contralateral granuloma). I personally spoke with both nuclear med and radiology. I relayed the above to Dr Terry Murray who will arrange EBUS. I called the patient and left a message. I also spoke with Dr Carpenter who will see the patient today. I tried to reach Dr Seymour again but was unable.
Updated PLAN:
1. EBUS via Dr Murray -- patient will see Dr Murray today
2. If EBUS negative for mets, consider hepatic and primary resection. If EBUS positive for mets, I would recommend chemo without curative-intent surgery.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, but would like additional information. Advance Directive information packet provided to the patient. JF6803-81, HS9593-67, AX0422-30, QZ7352-17.

Mr. Vickers is a 67-year-old man from the Wabbaseka area with the following oncologic history:
1.  He presented with very mild rectal bleeding (he passed blood about once or twice without clots) and occasional mild abdominal pain. Colonoscopy showed a rectal tumor, near circumferential, at 7-cm with biopsy revealing invasive adenocarcinoma.  CEA was 700.
2.  November 5 CT and November 9 PET scan showed four liver lesions, two of which were PET-avid.  The two largest ones were in the right lobe, 3.1 cm and 9-mm.  Our read shows left upper lobe 6-mm lung nodule (indeterminate) and right paratracheal node (8-mm short diameter -- not meeting abnormal criteria) -- no hilar adenopathy on our read. Both right paratracheal and hilar nodes were mildly PET-positive on outside read -- our review is pending.  Outside PET read said "probable" right hilar metastases and almost certain liver metastases.
3.  November 17, 2009, to December 30, 2009--the patient received radiation to the rectum of 45 Gy with a 9-Gy boost to the rectum.
4.  December 24, 2009--chest CT showed again the left upper lobe lesion, and the right hilar lesions were not reported as being prominent.
After radiation, the patient had one more episode of pink-tinged stool in the toilet (around early Jan 2010), and none since.
The patient has no pain.  He tolerated his chemoradiation rather well, which was 5-FU continuous infusion with radiation.  He has a good appetite.  He is retired.  No weight-loss.
