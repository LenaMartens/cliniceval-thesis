Reviewed outside records, including scope reports and pathology reports.
#1 Distal rectal cancer
Mrs. Mcfarland presents to GI for staging and evaluation of her distal rectal cancer.  Had a very frank discussion with the patient.  At this time, we will proceed with staging CT abdomen and pelvis and endoscopic ultrasound after which she will me with Dr. Cooper from Colon & Rectal Surgery.  She will also meet with  a stomal therapist for education purposes.  Her outside PET will be sent to Radiology along with the MRI.  We discussed the role of preoperative chemoradiation if T3 of N1 disease is noted.  Patient would be interested in laparoscopic surgery if this is possible.
#2 Skin lesion
Will refer to Dermatology for evaluation and rule-out basal cell carcinoma
#3 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work and chest x-ray are pending.  Given the patient's age, lack of cardiac symptoms and history, will not check an ECG  at this time.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, patient is okay for anesthesia.
Discussed with Dr. Heidi Mcnutt whose not is to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mrs. Mcfarland is a 44-year-old woman who presents to GI for evaluation of rectal cancer.  Mrs. Mcfarland developed intermittent rectal bleeding in late 2009 similar to symptoms four or five years ago when a fecal occult blood test was negative.  Her first full colonoscopy May 5, 2010, was positive for a 2-cm mass in he rectum, 90% removed and found to be a villous adenoma with a focal high-grade dysplasia.  Follow-up colonoscopy June 8, 2010, once more was positive for 2-cm flat villous carpet-like lesion treated 90% and tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia on pathology.  Colonoscopy was repeated July 6 , 2010, showing a-1.5-cm, flat, villous-appearing lesion that was once again biopsied with cold snare and residual ablated with gold probe ablation.  Pathology this time demonstrated cancer, and therefore she was referred for transanal endoscopic microsurgery removal (TEM).  This was performed August 16, 2010, of a lesion described located just above the anorectal ring. Unfortunately, the pathology from this procedure demonstrated a T2 lesion; and therefore, she received further staging studies with a PET CT August 30, 2010, which showed a hypermetabolic focus in the right pelvis thought to represent an abnormal lymph node with activity in the distal rectum, likely the primary neoplasm.  There is no evidence of disease in the liver.  Genetic testing for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 was negative for evidence of Lynch syndrome.  Previous CT-scan showed a liver cyst which was also confirmed on MRI.
Mrs. Mcfarland has no symptoms.  She has one bowel movement per day with no urgency or incontinence.  Please see family history below.
Mrs. Mcfarland has no chronic comorbidities, including no cardiopulmonary disease, history of bleeding disorder, heart attack, stroke, sleep apnea, or glaucoma.
