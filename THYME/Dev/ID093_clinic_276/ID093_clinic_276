#1 Resected T3, N0, M0 rectal carcinoma
PLAN
Mr. Schrimsher was diagnosed with a rectal carcinoma and was given six cycles (three-months) of FOLFOX in anticipation of subsequent surgery.  He did not receive neoadjuvant radiation therapy, as he had already had radiation therapy to the pelvis for a previous prostate carcinoma.  The patient tolerated FOLFOX without difficulty.  He now underwent a pelvic exenteration.  Fifteen nodes were negative.  There was no residual prostate carcinoma in the specimen either.
Mr. Schrimsher has been treated in Tioga, and the plan was for him to have an additional six cycles (three-months) of FOLFOX postop, and we would agree with this plan.  I hope he does well with this treatment and has no recurrence of his cancer.  He will be followed in Tioga also for his prior prostate carcinoma (PSA is rising).  He understands what is involved with this follow-up also.  We are not setting up a return appointment for him in Oncology.  Should he develop a recurrence of his cancer, we would, of course, be happy to see him at that time.
