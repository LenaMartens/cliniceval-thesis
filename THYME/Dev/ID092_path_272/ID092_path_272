Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 5.1 x 3.6 x 0.6 cm polypoid mass in the cecum.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (25) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  Appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
