Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Cooper service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions. I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Scott, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  She is unclear if she would be able to return in approximately four weeks for a formal recommendation.  Therefore, I will have Dr. Scott see her and make formal recommendations.  Please refer to his note for formal recommendations.

[end section id="20102"]

Mrs. Mcfarland is a pleasant 44-year-old woman who recently underwent resection of her node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma.  Seeing her today to discuss treatment recommendations at the request of Dr. Cooper' surgical service.  Her history is as follows:
1.  Late 2009: developed bright-red blood per rectum, fecal occult testing negative.
2.  5 May, 2010: first ever colonoscopy noting a 2-cm mass in the rectum.  90% of the mass was removed, pathology positive for villous adenoma with focal high-grade dysplasia.
3.  8 June, 2010: Repeat colonoscopy noting a 2-cm flat villous carpet like lesion in the rectum.  90% of the lesion treated, pathology positive for tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  CT-scan performed at this time noting a cyst within the liver.
4.  17 June, 2010: MRI scan documenting cysts within the liver.
5.  6 July, 2010: Colonoscopy performed noting a 1.5-cm flat villous appearing lesion, biopsy of this lesion was positive for adenocarcinoma.  The residual lesion was treated with gold probe ablation.
6.  16 August, 2010: Transanal endoscopic microsurgery performed and noted the lesion was just above the anorectal ring.  Outside pathology stating this was a T2 lesion, Washoe Urgent Care-Ryland Medical Center pathology staged T3 lesion with extension through the muscularis propria with focal involvement of the anal canal skeletal muscle.
7.  30 August, 2010 PET CT noting uptake in the right pelvis suspicious for an abnormal lymph node versus the right adnexa.  Also positive was the distal rectum.  Patient underwent testing for Lynch syndrome which was negative.
8.  14 September, 2010: Presented to Washoe Urgent Care-Ryland Medical Center for further workup.  CT abdomen and pelvis noting a stable 6-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe, a 3.4 cm mass left adnexal region (stable), enlargement of the uterus suggestive of fibroids, and cyst within the superior right lobe of the liver.
9.  15 September, 2010: Colonoscopy with EUS performed noting at the anastomosis a 2-cm indeterminate area with heaped up edges.  Unable to determine depth of tumor due to previous procedures.  A 3-mm indeterminate perirectal lymph node noted adjacent to the anastomosis, not biopsy due to location.  Pathology of the tissue removed positive for inflammatory granulation tissue.
10.  9 November, 2010: Consultation with Dr. Green of the radiation oncology Department.  Recommended consideration of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.  Discuss situation with the surgeon and patient decided to proceed with surgery to be followed with potential therapy.
11.  10 November, 2010: Dr. Cooper and Dr. Barfield performed abdominal perineal resection with vaginal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  During surgical exploration there was no evidence of metastatic disease within the liver, peritoneum or pelvis.  Pathology of the rectal tissue positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma within the muscularis propria and perirectal fat.  Tumor extends to within 2-mm of the anterior lateral radial resected margin (Dr. Cooper said this is in close proximity to the tissue removed during hysterectomy).  Of 16 regional lymph nodes removed four were positive for adenocarcinoma.  Pathology from the left ovary notes adult granulosa cell tumor.  Rectal cancer staged T3, N2.
Today, Mrs. Mcfarland is two days postoperative.  She is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  Family members were present during this consultation.
