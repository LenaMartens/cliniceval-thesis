Final Diagnosis
A.  Ovary and fallopian tube, left, salpingo-oophorectomy: Benign ovary with a fibroma (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm).  The left fallopian tube is unremarkable.

B.  Colon, descending and sigmoid, segmental resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (3.1 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm) located in the descending colon, 18.3 cm from the closest (proximal) margin.  The tumor focally invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (greater than 60) diverticula are also identified.  Multiple (79) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. [AJCC pT2N0MX]

C.  Ovary and fallopian tube, right, salpingo-oophorectomy:  Fibrothecoma (3.3 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm) involving the ovary.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.  Seen in consultation with Ashley D. Hanks, M.D.

For results of reflexive molecular genetic testing for HNPCC, see Molecular Genetics report in OXEZ PxvaVywv.
This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""left ovary and fallopian tube"" is a 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm ovary with a 6.4 x 0.5 cm attached fallopian tube.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface.  There is a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm white mass involving nearly the entire ovary.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by GUY.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""descending and sigmoid colon"" is a 56.5 cm in length portion of descending and sigmoid colon with a 3.1 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm ulcerative mass located 18.3 cm from the proximal mucosal resection margin and 2.3 cm from the radial margin.  Deepest tumor invasion is 0.7 cm and tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Multiple (greater than 60) diverticula are also identified.  There is a separately submitted 11.8 cm segment of colon with anastomosis.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by GUY.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""right ovary and fallopian tube"" is a 4.2 x 3.3 x 2.6 cm ovary with a 6.7 x 0.6 cm attached fallopian tube.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and a cystic (1.7 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm) and solid (yellow mass, 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm with a 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm white center; tan nodule, 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm) cut surface.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by GUY.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Jane Swett, immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed on paraffin-embedded colon cancer tissue sections (block B4).  There is aberrant loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 within the cells.  Internal positive control staining is present.  MSH2 and MSH6 expression is intact within both the neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells.  The findings confirm defective DNA mismatch repair due to loss of MLH1 expression with secondary loss of PMS2.  MLH1 hypermethylation and BRAF mutation analysis will be performed.  When completed, the findings will be available in OXEZ PxvaVywv.


Internal Comments
3/10/10--6 molgen cuts to MG for MLH1 hypermethylation and BRAF mutation analysis at request of Dr. Jane Swett/arthur
