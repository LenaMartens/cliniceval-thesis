Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, transverse, resection:  Poorly differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, necrotic, annular mass (5.7 x 5.5 x 2.2 cm).  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4 of 34) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  In addition, multiple (6) benign omental lymph nodes are identified. 

B.  Lymph nodes, left peri-aortic, excision:  Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic primary.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""transverse colon"" is a transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 33.7 cm of transverse colon and 22.3 x 12.5 x 1.8 cm portion of omentum.  A 5.7 x 5.5 x 2.2 cm ulcerative polypoid annular mass is present within the transverse colon, 12.5 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  The deepest extent of the tumor is 2.2 cm, and tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple (#) lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by HUBERT.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""left periaortic lymph nodes"" is a 4.3 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue submitted in multiple (6) pieces.  Multiple (2) representative sections of lymph nodes are submitted. Grossed by HUBERT.
