#1 Treatment recommendations for metastatic cecal adenocarcinoma, metastasis to liver
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Williams through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mr. Lofton is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman from Windsor Locks, Connecticut.  We are seeing him today to discuss treatment recommendations for an individual with a diagnosis of a metastatic cecal adenocarcinoma, metastasis to liver.  His history is as follows:
1.  June 30, 2009:  Due to constipation, change in stool character (ribbonlike), and abdominal pain, underwent first-ever colonoscopy which documented a mass in the right colon.  This was biopsied and found to be invasive adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated.  Patient also had multiple small polyps removed from the transverse and sigmoid colon, all benign.  Upper GI performed at that time was negative.
2.  July 7, 2009:  CT abdomen and pelvis documented an ill-defined cecal mass as well as multiple hepatic lesions.
3.  July 14, 2009:  PET/CT noted hypermetabolic activity in the mass in the cecum as well as multiple lesions in the liver, mainly in the right lobe.  States that in the left lobe there was one lesion and at the junction of the right and left lobe an additional lesion.  Due to this diffuse disease, surgeon stated he was not a surgical candidate at that time.
4.  July 24, 2009:  CEA elevated at 82.  Evaluated by oncologist who recommended systemic chemotherapy versus resection first.
5.  July 28, 2009, through November 2009:  Treated with ten cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Avastin was not administered due to concern about primary tumor bleeding.  During this therapy, CT scans performed in September and then subsequently in November noted stable disease first and then secondly a decrease in the liver lesions.  Patient also had a repeat colonoscopy in November 2009 which documented a decrease in the size of the tumor that was now bypassable.  It measured 2.5 to 3-cm.
6.  December 2009 through February 16, 2010:  Due to developing hearing loss and vertigo, oxaliplatin was discontinued.  Patient continued with 5-FU/leucovorin therapy and had a total of five treatments to-date.  During this time, did have an MRI scan of the head which was negative.  In January, CEA was noted to be normal at 2.0.  CT-scan also performed in January noted stable liver disease; however, when compared to July of 2009, lesions were smaller.
Today, Mr. Lofton states that he feels relatively well.  He states that his appetite has been good, although he has noticed an altered taste, especially a couple days following chemotherapy administration.  He reports that his weight has been stable.  Energy level has been good.  Reports that his bowels have returned to normal.  Denies any blood or mucus in his stool.  During chemotherapy, he denies any evidence of nausea or vomiting.  He did develop mouth sores with the original therapy but now is on a mouthwash that has resolved that issue, as well as changing his toothpaste.  He has noticed that the skin on his hands and feet are dryer than what they had been previously.  Otherwise, he has no changes to his skin.  He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
