Reviewed outside colonoscopy and pathology and radiology reports.  His CT is on QREADS.
IMPRESSION
#1 Colorectal cancer in the setting of FAP
Discussed cancer staging treatment and surveillance with the patient and his wife as well as the disease entity of FAP.  We discussed the various surgical options including IPAA and Brooke ileostomy.  The patient will undergo further staging with repeat colonoscopy and EUS for a rectal cancer as well as an extended EGD with side-viewing scope to assess for upper GI neoplasms.  CT enterography will also be requested to rule-out small-bowel polyps and desmoid.  His outside CT will be sent to Radiology for interpretation.  The patient will be asked to meet with stoma therapy for ileostomy education and will meet with Colorectal Surgery for surgical recommendations.  The patient understands that if indeed this is rectal cancer and is T3 or N1, neoadjuvant chemoradiation will be advised prior to surgical resection.
Discussed with Dr. Lindsay Johnson, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Mr. Joyner is a 31-year-old gentleman who is referred for treatment of colorectal cancer in the setting of FAP.  There is no family history known of FAP.  Mr. Joyner developed rectal bleeding the first-time last fall.  His symptoms appeared more recurrent this spring, and he also developed back pain which prompted him to seek medical evaluation.  Stools also changed with an increase up to six to eight narrowed stools daily.  His first colonoscopy March 29, 2010, was positive for numerous polyps throughout the colon.  A 50% circumferential mass was also noted, described in the colonoscopy report at 50 cm but on the pathology report is labeled 15-cm.  Pathology demonstrated an infiltrating moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a focal mucinous component.  Biopsies from other polyps were also taken including a pedunculated polyp removed from the sigmoid colon that was a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia, and biopsies from the cecum were obtained, found to be tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  Tuscaloosa Surgical County Medical Clinic Pathology has reviewed slides but describes the cancer as an intramucosal adenocarcinoma.  CT abdomen, pelvis March 30, 2010, was negative for metastatic disease.  There was some described artifact from rectal barium of which I am unclear are masses the implication of this.  Mr. Joyner has not yet had genetic testing.  Please see Family History below for other details regarding colorectal neoplasia in the family.  He is, otherwise, healthy with no chronic comorbidities.  There is no history of bleeding disorder, anesthesia reaction, medication allergies, nicotine dependence, hypertension, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, glaucoma, or sleep apnea.
