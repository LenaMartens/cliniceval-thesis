#1 Resected stage II colon cancer with multiple recurrences
She has now had resection of her most recent recurrence in January of this year.  She has recovered nicely.  Because she had multiple recurrences, special studies were obtained that demonstrated microsatellite instability.  This was later determined to be a BRAF epigenetic mutation rather than a somatic mutation.  Her CT is without evidence of metastatic disease, and her CEA is back to normal.  I will see her in three-months for repeat clinical assessment with cross-sectional imaging and laboratory studies.  There is no role for chemotherapy here, escpecially given the MSI-H nature of her T2 tumor.  She should be re-scoped in about a year's time.
#2 Breast nodule
This feels completely benign in nature.  However, there is no way to be 100% certain.  I discussed this with her.  Will continue to follow this clinically.  I do not believe we need any advanced imaging or biopsies at this time.  She concurs with that.  She has agreed to call me if this increases in size or becomes tender in any way.
#3 Diarrhea
This is under good control on her current regimen.  I have refilled her prescription for the cholestyramine.
#4 Insomnia
It has been a number of years since she has seen her primary-care physician.  I refilled her Ativan prescription, which she uses as a sleep aid and has been doing so nightly for at least the last 5-10 years.
#5 Hypertension
I have also refilled her prescription for the diltiazem.
Follow-up:  I would like to have her follow-up with her primary-care physician.  It has been a number of years since she has been seen at the Frankfort State Medical Center out in Walnut Creek.  I have asked her to schedule an appointment with Dr. Taylor out there, who has seen her in the past.  I discussed with her that it is probably more appropriate for him to follow things like insomnia and hypertension while I continue to follow her cancer-related complaints.  He is also much closer to her home and much more convenient for her to see.  I will see her back in three-months' time with a repeat mammogram, as it has been two years, and the studies as noted above.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Mrs. Hollingsworth's oncological history is as follows:
1.  2003--Mrs. Hollingsworth underwent a resection of a T2, N0 adenocarcinoma of the right colon.
2.  April 2006--Mrs. Hollingsworth underwent a left nephrectomy for what turned out to be oncocytoma, as well as a wide local resection with end-to-end reanastomosis of an ileal colonic T2, grade 4, adenocarcinoma.  Again this was N0, M0.
3.  November 2008--the patient's CEA is 6.1 at this time, which is slightly above her baseline in the mid 4s.  Repeat CT scanning suggests a new mass in the pelvis.
4.  December 2008--excision of the mass in the abdomen reveals no evidence of malignancy.
5.  January 2010--has a T2, N0, M0 colon cancer resected by Dr. Sullins.  Recovers nicely.
Mrs. Hollingsworth returns today for follow-up.  She has been doing well postoperatively.  Because of the diarrhea she was having back in December we had sent her for a colonoscopy, and it turned out she had a new colon cancer.  This was resected with no complications by Dr. Sullins.  She has been doing well.  Her energy level is good.  Her diarrhea is well-controlled.  She does have her stoma now which has been causing her no problems whatsoever.  She is active and feeling well.  She has recently palpated a nodule in her right chest wall area underneath her incision that she is not sure how long has been there.  It is not tender, and it has not been growing enlarging.

Reports:  Laboratory studies obtained today include a CBC significant for hemoglobin of 12.9, leukocytes 5.1, platelets 236, potassium 4.5, calcium 10.0, alkaline phosphatase 85, AST 25, total bilirubin 0.6, creatinine 1.1.  CEA 3.3; this is down from 8 preoperatively.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no evidence of residual or metastatic disease.Spine:  There is no spinous process tenderness nor any SI joint tenderness.Musculoskeletal:  Gait is completely normal.  She is up and off the table with ease.Lungs:  Completely clear to auscultation.Vessels:  Her distal pulses are 3/5 and symmetric.Breasts:  Examination of her left breast is completely normal.  There is no supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.  On the right-side there is a very well-healed surgical scar.  Midline on this anterior surgical scar there is a very soft, freely mobile round irregularity that is just subcutaneous and is not attached to the chest wall.  This for all intents and purposes feels exactly like a fatty tumor.  It is completely nontender.  There is no overlying erythema or irregularity.General:  Well-appearing woman appearing quite younger than her stated age.Extremities:  There is no pedal or pretibial edema.Eyes:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae are pink and moist, noninjected, nonindurated.Heart:  Rate and rhythm regular.  No murmurs.Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  There is no organomegaly.  Her stoma site appears intact.ENT:  Pink and moist mucous membranes.  No lesions.  Good dentition.
