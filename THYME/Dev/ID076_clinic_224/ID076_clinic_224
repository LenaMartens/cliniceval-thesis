#1 Synchronous colon cancers in the setting of colonic polyposis
Mr. Wedgeworth presents for treatment of his colon cancers.  He has a biopsy-proven cancer in the cecum, and a synchronous growth in the descending colon which is apple-core-type lesion on CT, but biopsy did not confirm malignancy.  I discussed rational for subtotal colectomy with the patient.  He could consider ileorectostomy versus ileostomy versus a J-pouch if this is surgically advisable.  His scans will be sent to Radiology for interpretation.  We will request repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy by the colon and rectal surgeon to assess for rectosigmoid sparing which will hopefully assist with surgical decision-making.  Immunohistochemistry staining has also been requested to rule-out Lynch syndrome.
#2 Skin lesion
I have requested Dermatology evaluation.
#3 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work and ECG are requested.  His outside chest x-ray was sent to Radiology for interpretation.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, patient is OK for anesthesia.  All this was discussed with Dr. Lang, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Synchronous colon cancers in the setting of colonic polyposis.

Mr. Wedgeworth is a 66-year-old gentleman, who is referred for synchronous colon cancer.  Mr. Wedgeworth developed flu-like symptoms, nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, and actually passed out.  He took an ambulance to the hospital and was found to have a hemoglobin of 6.8.  After 2 units of blood, he underwent colonoscopy and EGD April 2, 2010.  EGD showed antritis, and the colonoscopy was significant for numerous colon polyps.  A colonoscopy specifically identified a large fungating mass in the cecum as well as another large fungating mass in the descending colon.  Numerous other polyps were found but not removed.  Larger lesions were biopsied, and pathology demonstrates adenocarcinoma from the cecum and tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia and tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia from other polyps.  The mass was tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia on biopsy; however, this is likely sampling error.  There were multiple polyps also removed from the rectum and sigmoid.  The largest in the rectum was measuring 10-mm and tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia on pathology.  The other rectal sigmoid lesions were all hyperplastic.  These were removed according to the report.  Stating CT abdomen and pelvis was negative for metastatic disease as was chest x-ray.  CEA was elevated at 3.7 April 2, 2010.  Mr. Wedgeworth now presents to Grafton State Hospital for treatment.  Mr. Wedgeworth's only previous colonoscopy was performed for hematochezia in 1994, and 17 polyps ranging in size from 2-mm to 2-cm were found all of which were hyperplastic.  Surveillance colonoscopy had been advised in one-year.
Comorbidities include hypertension for which he uses diuretic therapy.  There is a history of COPD, although he currently does not use any inhalers and denies any pulmonary symptoms.  There is no history of heart disease, and he is asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint.  He does consume significant alcohol, acknowledging five to six per day including beer and whiskey.  He quit smoking approximately ten years ago.  There is no history of medication allergies, bleeding disorders, anesthesia reactions, thrombosis, glaucoma, or sleep apnea.  His dentition is poor, but he denies any loose teeth.
