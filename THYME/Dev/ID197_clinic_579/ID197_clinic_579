#1 Rectal cancer
#2 History of Gleason 5 to 6 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, cT2a, NX, MX, status-post combined external-beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy
#3 Erectile dysfunction
I had the opportunity to review with Reverend Hargrove and his family our current findings.  I discussed my concern that his rectal mass appears by physical examination as well as imaging to possibly be invading the prostate.  We discussed the risk of attempting to remove the prostate from the rectal mass, as this may leave tumor behind and has the potential to fistulize with his history of cancer as well as radiation. In the event that we are able to safely remove the mass from the prostate and bladder, we would do so.  We did discuss the surgical procedure, surgical convalescence, and length of hospitalization from a urologic perspective.  All questions were answered fully.
DISPOSITION

Reverend Hargrove is a very pleasant 63-year-old gentleman who has a history of Gleason 5 to 6 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, cT2a, NX, MX.  He subsequently underwent combined brachytherapy with 109 seeds as well as external-beam radiotherapy totaling 4500 Gy in 1998.  His PSA subsequently declined to undetectable.
He currently denies any hesitancy, decreased stream, and incomplete emptying.  He does a history of hematuria as well as nephrolithiasis.  He did notice rectal pain and pressure and was subsequently evaluated by colorectal surgeons who did a scope and noticed a large ulcer located on the anterior surface of the rectum.  This was biopsied and showed rectal cancer.  He was subsequently referred to Dr. Mccloud for further evaluation.  Urology was asked to evaluate the patient for surgical intervention.
He currently denies any persistent pelvic pain or any erectile dysfunction.

Rectum:  A digital rectal examination demonstrates a large ulcer can be palpated on the anterior surface of the rectum.  This feels to be in direct continuity with the prostate.  I was unable to palpate beyond this secondary to the patient's discomfort.General:  He is alert and oriented in no distress.Genitalia:  No masses down the penile shaft.  Testicles are descended bilaterally without masses.Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.

Hemoglobin 11.3, white count 8.3, platelets 285.
Sodium 140, potassium 5.1, glucose 161.
Creatinine 0.8, BUN 12, chloride 102, bicarbonate 32.
PSA is <0.1.
CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis is reviewed from July 26, 2010.  He does have a small stone located in the left kidney.  There is no evidence of any renal masses or any hydroureteronephrosis.  He does not have any significant retroperitoneal adenopathy.  Multiple brachy seeds are identified within the prostatic fossa.  There does appear to be significant peripheral loading of the seeds which appear to extend into the perirectal area as well as the perivesical area.  No evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy.
