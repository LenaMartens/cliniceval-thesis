Mr. Vickers suffers from a resected stage IV rectal cancer with resected liver metastases and questionable R1 resection of the local tumor.  Radiation Oncology, Dr. Calhoun, had already been consulted, and he did not recommend any additional radiation therapy to this area.  I am in agreement with his assessment.
I reviewed the stage of disease with the patient and highlighted the fact that he is at high-risk for tumor recurrence, not only with regard to the pelvic situation, but also with regard to the liver metastases.  It is of note that he has not received any highly systemically active chemotherapy before the liver resection was performed in the situation where we are facing a synchronous tumor.
With regard to the future management, I would recommend to bring the patient back in about four weeks for a CT evaluation which will then include chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  While I do not anticipate any definitive sign of recurrence in the pelvis, I am more concerned about the emergence of liver metastasis and potentially even lung metastasis in view of the rectal location of the cancer, and the fact that we did indeed have PET uptake in some mediastinal nodes.  I realize that these lymph nodes were biopsied, but I am still worried about a potential pulmonary or intrathoracic recurrence.
Regardless, what we are going to see in the scans, the next step in the patient's management would be to use systemic chemotherapy, either as an adjuvant therapy after successful stage IV resection, or as treatment for potentially emerging metastasis.  The patient would like to come to Osteopathic of Schuyler for the scans, and then discuss with his oncologist here, Dr. Coker, about the future management of his disease.  If we see signs of tumor recurrence, I would recommend a FOLFOX plus bevacizumab-based regimen.  If we do not see any signs of recurrence, I would use adjuvant FOLFOX.  I anticipate treatment duration of about four to six-months, if we are facing adjuvant setting.
I will also place a call to our colleagues in Pathology to arrange for KRAS testing which would then give us an idea whether the patient would ever be a candidate for treatment with EGF receptor antibodies.
The patient was content with the information he received.  All questions were answered.

Mr. Vickers is a very pleasant 67-year-old patient from the Malibu area, who was diagnosed with a metastatic rectal cancer in November 2009.  His tumor was nearly circumferential, 7-cm from the anal verge with PET CT-scan identifying four liver lesions and indeterminate pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymph nodes which upon further evaluation, including bronchoscopy and ultrasound-guided biopsy, were found to be negative per Cytology.  The patient received 45 Gy with 9 Gy boost to the rectum from November to December 2009 with infusion of 5-FU with radiation sensitizer.  He came into Osteopathic of Schuyler and was evaluated by Dr. Marvin Coker of Medical Oncology, as well as Dr. Murray and Dr. Carpenter.  The patient was taken to the OR on February 25, 2010, for a rectosigmoid resection and liver segment excisions.  Pathology confirmed the presence of two intrahepatic metastases with free surgical margins, as well as a grade 3 or 4 adenocarcinoma invading into the pericolonic fat, and a second mass ulcerated in the rectum involving the adventitial radial margin. Three separate re-resections of presacral tissue were performed with eventual free margins.  Per surgical note, however, Dr. Carpenter thought he could only consider this an R1 resection.
Medical Oncology is now being consulted to obtain an opinion regarding the future management of the patient's disease.
Upon visit with the patient, he was resting comfortably in his bed.  He did had some postoperative abdominal pain, but was otherwise recovering well.
