I reviewed everything with the patient and her daughter.  I agree with Ms. Rubalcava's assessment and recommendations.  The benefit of chemotherapy is small in-patient's with T3, N0 tumors.  The patient has some neurologic deficit from her stroke, and she lives at-home with her husband who has also had a stroke.  In view of this, I would not recommend any adjuvant chemotherapy.  I have explained this to the daughter and to the patient.  They are both in agreement.  The patient will be following-up locally with her physicians and not planning to return here.  We will not see her again unless requested.

I have reviewed and confirm the history and physical examination as per Jesse Rubalcava's note of September 14, 2010, and agree with her evaluation.  Briefly, this is a lady with an underlying history of a stroke in June 2010 leading to gait changes and 12th nerve palsy, type-2 diabetes, and hypertension.  She developed weakness and was found to be anemic.  A cecal mass was found, and she was referred to Colonial Manor Home and Hospital where she had a proctocolectomy because of multiple polyps.  Her mismatch repair status is negative.  She is currently recovering.
