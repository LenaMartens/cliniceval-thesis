I carefully discussed with the patient and his wife the natural history of colorectal cancer with particular emphasis to what happens to patients with lymph node-positive disease; more so, with more than 10 lymph nodes involved by metastasis.  I also showed him data from the adjuvant web page, including that of survival with or without chemotherapy, using a regimen like FOLFOX or a regimen like Xeloda alone.
I believe that Mr. Kelly has a high-risk of developing metastasis and that he is otherwise a very healthy 68-year-old male.  My recommendation is for him to receive chemotherapy.  We discussed that chemotherapy can cause temporary immunosuppression, short, caused by neutropenia.  This may or may not happen with the doses of chemotherapy that he will receive.  He is on chronic immunosuppression of a different nature.  We discussed the difference between immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy for colon cancer versus immunosuppression to prevent transplant rejection.
We discussed potential side-effects of chemotherapy including nausea, vomiting, alopecia, neuropathy, fatigue, skin rash, cytopenias, infections, or bleeding.
I had the opportunity to discuss my consultation with Dr. Leslie Howell, from Cardiology Transplant.  Our colleagues will meet as a group to see if this is prudent or not to use adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer in the setting of chronic immunosuppression.
I think that a regimen using Xeloda plus oxaliplatin will be a good balance and adequate adjuvant chemotherapy with dosing that is easy to adjust and not requiring the placement of a Port-a-Cath.
I will see the patient in follow-up in approximately one-week.  At that time, I plan to start chemotherapy unless Cardiology has a different opinion.

I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Kelly, a 68-year-old male from Mc Alpin District of Columbia.  He came accompanied by his wife.  I spent one and one-half hours with the patient and also reviewed extensive Postville Good Samaritan Medical Center records.
1.  1979 - seminoma, presented with a 25-cm anterior mediastinal mass, primary tumor.  This was resected followed by postoperative radiation therapy followed by a single dose of Cytoxan.
2.  Developed cardiomyopathy caused by radiation therapy, underwent two heart transplantations, July 2003.
3.  September 20, 2010, laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for T3, N2b adenocarcinoma of the colon,13 of 17 resected lymph nodes involved with metastasis, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell.
Mr. Kelly has recovered from surgery without any complication and is up and about and asymptomatic.  I enjoyed very much spending at least one and one-half hours with the patient and his wife, talking to him, examining him, and reviewing extensive Postville Good Samaritan Medical Center records.
I refer the reader to the excellent note of my colleague Diane Hall, NP who saw the patient in initial consultation in the hospital after colon cancer surgery, September 22, 2010.
