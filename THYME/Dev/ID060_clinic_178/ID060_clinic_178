#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma with evidence of residual disease, T4, N2, M0
#2 Microcytic anemia secondary to No. 1
#3 Dyslipidemia
#4 Mild memory problems, currently on Aricept
PLAN
At this time, we would recommend chemotherapy.  We would recommend FOLFOX-6 therapy involving 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin.  In addition, due to evidence of residual disease, we would recommend addition of bevacizumab to this therapy.  The duration of therapy could be for six-months provided the patient tolerates this therapy and there is no evidence of disease progression.  We would recommend rechecking a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis in three-months' time to assess response ijn addition to CEA levels.  Should there be no evidence of disease progression, treatment for another three-months should be continued with FOLFOX plus Avastin every two-weeks.
In addition, we would check a K-ras mutation status on the tumor.  This would take a few weeks to return.  If she is K-ras wild type, cetuximab could be used as second-line therapy if there is evidence of disease progression or recurrence.  For now, the front-line therapy would be as outlined above.
In addition, we have recommended that she be started on oral iron, and I have given her a prescription for the same.  Her counts should be monitored closely, and her next CEA level should be checked in  three-months.  She should get a colonoscopy in about a year's time from her diagnosis of cancer.  I have gone over the side-effects including, but not limited to, myelosuppression, life-threatening infections, peripheral neuropathy, hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, bleeding, GI perforation, and CVA.  At this point, per patient and her husband's wishes, their care would be transferred to local oncologist, Dr. Terry Davis, at Dallas Community Health Facility APO San Francisco, California.  Mrs. Morrell will be meeting Dr. Wagner later today; and if it is okay with him, chemotherapy could be started anytime now.

Mrs. Morrell is a very pleasant 74-year-old lady from Farmington, Pennsylvania, who is accompanied by her husband today for further recommendations regarding aforementioned malignancy.  Her oncologic history is outlined below:
1.  April 2010, she started to experience intermittent back pain and midabdominal discomfort, vomiting, decreased appetite, and weight-loss for about four weeks.  In addition, she stated that her bowel habits had altered and she started to notice diarrhea alternating with constipation over a period of four weeks.
2.  May 12, 2010, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, and this demonstrated a transverse colon mass with regional lymph node involvement.  No evidence of distant disease was noted.  She did have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.5.
3.  May 14, 2010, she underwent a colonoscopy which demonstrated an obstructing mass lesion in distal transverse colon.  This was an incomplete colonoscopy since the scope could not be passed through the luminal narrowing as a result of this mass.  There was ulceration noted, and biopsies demonstrated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for CK7 but negative for CK20, CK5-6, CDX2, p63, estrogen-receptor, G6DFP-15, mammaglobin, and TTF-1.  It was interpreted as although it is still likely to represent a primary colonic adenocarcinoma, the immunophenotype and lack of adenomatous change in the adjacent colonic mucosa argued against this possibility.  Other considerations including METS or local invasion from a tumor arising in the upper GI tract or pancreas should be made.
4.  May 21, 2010, she underwent transverse colon resection with end-to-end transverse colocolostomy.  A very large tumor in the mid transverse colon that closely abutted in the inferior portion of the stomach was noted in addition to a 3-cm enlarged mesenteric node at the base of mesentery.  The tumor itself appeared to have penetrated through the omentum, covering the colon and was open to the peritoneal surface.  However, no peritoneal implants and no other evidence of spread of tumor was noted.  With some difficulty and some bleeding from superior mesenteric vein, the surgeons were able to remove the enlarged mesenteric node.  However, it was densely adherent and undoubtedly per notes, there was a small amount of tumor that was left behind.  The pathology was read as grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma forming a 6.6- x 3.8- x 2.7-cm mass in the transverse colon penetrating the visceral serosa.  The surgical margins were negative and 15 (out of 22) regional lymph nodes were involved by metastatic carcinoma.  It was considered as T4, N2 disease.
She has been recuperating well from surgery and most recently on June 21, 2010, she underwent another CT-scan of the abdomen which was compared with the preoperative examination of May 12.  There are still enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes medial to the left kidney lying between the upper end of ovarian vein and the abdominal aorta.  These nodes were seen  in the previous CT-scan and are unchanged in size.  The scan was interpreted as a possibility of residual disease and close attention should be paid to this area in the follow-up examinations.
She appears to be recovering well from surgery.  She currently denies any chest pain, shortness-of-breath, nausea, vomiting.  Her appetite is fair.  She denies any blood in stools.  She denies any abdominal pain or swelling of the feet.  She denies any bone pain or headache.

1.  Lumbar laminectomy for lumbar radiculopathy.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Postmenopausal.
4.  Underwent colonoscopy previously about eight years ago.
5.  Underwent a mammogram, early May 2010.  This was unremarkable.
6.  History of mild memory problems in the past.  Was started on Aricept in February 2009 which she states may a difference in her memory.
