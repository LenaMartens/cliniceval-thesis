#1 Colon cancer
We had a fairly extensive discussion today with Mrs. Metcalf and her family in regard to her diagnosis and our treatment recommendations.  Currently, at this time, it appears she at least has a T4, N1 tumor and could have metastatic lesions in the lung as well.  We do not have a prior CT-scan to compare with and see if these are stable in nature or increasing in size.  Per the size that is listed on the previous scan in 2008, the size has increased; but once again, it would be very important to review the imaging studies in comparison to each other.  We would also like the patient to visit with the Colorectal Surgery team for resection of her primary mass in the ascending colon.  If she does not have likely metastatic disease in her lungs, then this will be for staging purposes as well as for primary treatment.  If does have metastatic disease in her lungs, then this will be for palliative intent so as to reduce the risk of complications down the line from this primary mass involving the abdominal wall.  The patient is in agreement, and we will have her visit with Dr. West later this afternoon.  Otherwise, we will be waiting on her outside CT-scan to arrive as well as her outside pathology reports.  Once we have all of this information, then we will be able to provider further treatment recommendations.  The patient is agreeable, and we otherwise answered all of her questions today.  The patient does have my card.

Mrs. Metcalf is a very pleasant 78-year-old female from 29690 Bausman whose oncologic history is as follows:
1.  April 2010, the patient began noticing right lower quadrant pain that was dull in nature.  She brought this up with her PCP who eventually did a CT-scan showing a mass in the ascending colon.  She was then referred to the Anna Sundermann
2.  June 3, 2010, colonoscopy revealed a mass in the cecal area and ascending colon with a necrotic ulcer around the cecum.  Pathology from this mass showed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Additionally, she had a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on that day which showed concerning bilateral pulmonary nodules and also likely benign liver lesions.  Additionally, it did show the primary tumor in the ascending colon, possibly involving the abdominal wall.
Mrs. Metcalf presents to us today for treatment recommendations in regard to her colon cancer.  She has been seen by Dr. Dana Butler at the Green Hospital in regard to this diagnosis thus far.  Dr. Butler has recommended palliative chemotherapy for her as she likely has metastatic disease due to the pulmonary nodules.  The patient is coming here for a second opinion.  Additionally, the patient brings records from a CT-scan in 2008 mentioning some pulmonary nodules at that time; however, she does not have the CD with the images for comparison.  Dr. Butler also did not have these available during his evaluation.  The patient otherwise is doing well with minimal complaints.  She does have some continued right lower quadrant abdominal pain, but this is not too severe in nature.  She denies any significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stool, or blood in urine.  She denies other issues such as fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, cough, or urinary complaints.
The patient's ECOG performance status today is approximately a 0 to 1 as she is otherwise very healthy and has been working on her farm for the past 50+ years.  Her appetite is doing well.

General:  Pleasant, elderly female, younger-appearing than stated age.  Alert and oriented times three.  She is here with her son and friend.Abdomen:  Soft.  Mild tenderness to palpation along the right flank and right lower quadrant.  A mass is palpated in this region, approximately 5-cm in diameter.  The abdomen is nondistended.  Bowel sounds positive.  No hepatosplenomegaly otherwise.Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.ENT:  No oral lesions.Eyes:  No scleral icterus.Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.Lymph:  No submandibular, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal lymphadenopathy appreciated.Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.Neuro:  Alert and oriented times three.  No focal deficits apparent.Reports:  The patient's CBC shows a hemoglobin of 15.1, leukocytes 15.5, platelets normal.  Electrolytes, LFTs, and creatinine are all unremarkable.
I did review the patient's imaging scan from June 3, 2010, which shows the cecal mass likely involving the abdominal wall as well as multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions with most of these being only 1 to 2-mm with a couple larger ones being anywhere from 5 to 8-mm.  We do not have a prior scan to compare to; although, she does bring a CT-scan report from 2008 that mentions bilateral pulmonary lesion with a maximum size being up to 6-mm.
