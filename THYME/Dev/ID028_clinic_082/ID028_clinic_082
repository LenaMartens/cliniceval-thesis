#1 Midrectal cancer, T3
Clearly this patient needs surgery, but I think he would be certainly better served with preop chemoradiation therapy to try and decrease the size of the tumor to allow an easier dissection plane and hopefully to make it easier to establish intestinal continuity.  The multimodality nature of therapy was discussed with the patient, and he will be referred to Medical and Radiation Oncology colleagues.

Newly-diagnosed rectal cancer.

This is a 65-year-old gentleman who over the last little while has noted a significant change in his bowel habits with blood on the stool, a lot of mucousy discharge, a change in stool caliber.  He was then referred for a colonoscopy and was found to have a circumferential lesion in the mid rectum which was biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma.  Endoscopic evaluation by ultrasound has shown it to be a T3 lesion.  There are some lymph nodes, but they cannot biopsy them because they will be going through the tumor.  The CT-scan has not shown any significant lymphadenopathy or disease in the liver.

IMAGING STUDIES
I have reviewed the CT-scan that shows a large, bulky tumor in the midrectum.
