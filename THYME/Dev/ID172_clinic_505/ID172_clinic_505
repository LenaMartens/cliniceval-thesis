I had a long discussion with Mrs. Messersmith about the rationale for adjuvant chemotherapy in her situation.  The tumor was classified as a clinical stage III based on EUS criteria with a suspicious lymph node in the peritumoral region.  In addition, the actual tumor was found to be a T3 lesion per EUS criteria.  Eventual tumor stage after therapy was a T2, N0 lesion which can be interpreted as evidence of a treatment effect.
Given Mr. Messersmith's young age as well as the fact that at least pretreatment lymph node involvement was suspected, I would favor an oxaliplatin-based regimen as adjuvant therapy.  The patient already has a Port-A-Cath device in place so that we will be able to administer FOLFOX and standard treatment for eight cycles.  The patient will come to Shreveport Charity Memorial Hospital for this treatment, and she will start her therapy tomorrow.
I have reviewed potential side-effects of this treatment including, but not limited to, myelosuppression, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and sensory neuropathy on oxaliplatin.
Mrs. Messersmith voiced understanding.
She will return to Shreveport Charity Memorial Hospital in two-weeks for her second cycle of therapy.

Mrs. Messersmith is a very pleasant 46-year-old patient from northern Ohio who was diagnosed with a rectal cancer in May of 2010.  Per EUS criteria, a uT3, N1 tumor was identified from 6 to 11-cm from the anal verge.  The patient came to Shreveport Charity Memorial Hospital for therapy and received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with continuous-infusion 5-FU as radiation sensitizer and radiation dose of 50.4 Gy.  Subsequently, Dr. Gutierrez took the patient to surgery on September 3, 2010, for a proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.  Pathology revealed residual moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma that measured 0.2-cm maximum dimension in association with a 3.2-cm ulcer.  The tumor invaded the submucosa as a T2 tumor.  Lymphovascular invasion was not seen.  Twenty-one regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor involvement.
Mrs. Messersmith is now seen by Medical Oncology to discuss potential postoperative adjuvant treatment options.  She underwent a Port-A-Cath placement today.  Discussions had already been conducted with her regarding the use of an oxaliplatin-based regimen as adjuvant therapy.
Upon presentation today, she stated that she had well recovered from surgery.  She still had some pain in her perineal region for which is taking ibuprofen.  Otherwise, she feels fine.
