#1 Distal ascending colon adenocarcinoma
We discussed with Mrs. Hollis regarding the next step which is staging and meeting with a surgeon.  We will obtain preoperative laboratory testing, and also we will perform a CT-scan with IV contrast to evaluate staging.  We will see her back after these are completed.
#2 Perioperative evaluation
Given Mrs. Hollis's symptoms on the treadmill, I am concerned that these are angina or angina-like symptoms.  Given her aortic stenosis and the prior mild coronary disease seen on the CT-scan in 2007, we have requested an evaluation in Cardiology along with a stress echo cardiogram to be performed on a treadmill to further risk stratify her prior to her surgery.

Mrs. Hollis is a pleasant 74-year-old female with hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, mild coronary disease who comes in for evaluation of a newly discovered distal ascending colon adenocarcinoma.
Mrs. Hollis has described symptoms of easy fatigue for the past two years.  She has noticed changes in her stool caliber and some stomach discomfort.  She denies any fevers or chills.  Maybe a couple pounds of weight-loss.  She was seen in our primary-care physician's office, and a routine CBC showed iron-deficiency anemia.  She was scheduled for a colonoscopy.  Her last colonoscopy performed in 2003 was essentially normal with two small polyps is what I am told.  However, the colonoscopy performed on July 9, 2010, showed a large mass in the distal ascending colon occupying 70 to 99% of the circumference of the colon.  Tattoo markings were placed just distal to the mass.  They also comment on moderate diverticulosis, and they commented that the preparation was good.  She has had a CA-125 which level was 1.6 drawn after the pathology came back as grade II invasive adenocarcinoma.
Mrs. Hollis is able to exercise regularly.  However, she notices during the first few minutes of her exercise that she has a tightness in her chest and some pain in her jaw which typically goes away as she continues the exercise on her treadmill.  She states she can walk four flights of stairs without difficulty.  She has had prior nausea and vomiting after a general anesthesia but no specific anesthesia complications.  Her lungs are essentially normal as far as she knows except for that she had a spontaneous pneumothorax back in the 1990s which was treated.
