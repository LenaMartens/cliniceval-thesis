IMPRESSION
#1 Distal rectal cancer status-post adjuvant chemotherapy
Mr. Schrimsher is referred to Sunset Haven Valley Mental Hospital for surgical treatment of distal rectal cancer.  He completed adjuvant chemotherapy in October 2009.  He did not receive neoadjuvant radiation therapy given his history of external-beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2008.  He is referred to Everest specifically for consideration of intraoperative radiation therapy at the time of surgical resection given the risk for positive margins as the tumor is quite bulky.  I discussed with Mr. and Mrs. Schrimsher role for restaging CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis especially given the pulmonary nodules.  Historically, he also has an indeterminate adrenal nodule that we will evaluate with blood work and on CT.  Mr. Schrimsher would like to have urinary incontinence issues addressed at the time of surgery as well.  Therefore, Urology consultation will be requested in addition to Radiation Oncology consultation with Dr. Maddox.  Patient will also be meeting with Dr. Linda Dion of Colon and Rectal Surgery, to whom he was specifically referred.  He will also need to meet with enterostomal therapy preoperatively.  After discussion with Dr. Villasenor, immunohistochemistry staining has been requested given his family history.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray and ECG are pending.  Please see HPI for his history of COPD and recent hospitalization requiring steroids.  He will likely require a steroid boost preoperatively.  His last dose of steroid was December 21, 2009.  He also has a history of ITP and nicotine dependance, although he quit smoking approximately two years ago.  Will obtain PFTs and Pulmonology consult as well as Hematology consult for evaluation of these issues preoperatively.
Discussed with Dr. Villasenor, note to follow.

Rectal cancer status-post adjuvant chemotherapy.

Mr. Schrimsher is a 71-year-old gentleman referred by Dr. Johnson for surgical treatment of distal rectal cancer.  Mr. Schrimsher underwent his colonoscopy for fatigue on June 4, 2009.  A large rectal mass described 4-cm above the anal verge was noted with no synchronous lesions.  A complete exam was performed to the cecum.  Biopsies confirm moderately differentiated invasive rectal adenocarcinoma, and Ashley Hospital pathology confirms invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Staging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis June 4, 2009, demonstrated a 4-mm nodule in the right upper lobe on image 21, a 4-mm nodule right upper lobe on image 29, an ill-defined ground-glass nodule right upper lobe on image 32, a 4-mm left upper lobe upper nodule on image 39, and multiple 2- to 4-mm nodules in the left lower lobe.  Scarring and emphysematous changes were also noted in the long apices.  There is no evidence of hepatic metastasis or inguinal retroperitoneal adenopathy.  Abnormal soft-tissue thickening of the rectum was observed.  MRI of the pelvis June 5, 2009, showed thickening of the bowel wall from the rectosigmoid junction to the anal verge with no evidence of lymphadenopathy or spinal involvement.  There was a question of a-1-cm enhancing lesion  in the left femoral head.  Ashley Hospital radiology has reviewed this film and describes no evidence of boney metastasis or sacral invasion.  Circumferential thickening of the bladder wall was noted consistent with either incomplete distension or radiation change.  Again seen was soft-tissue stranding  in the perirectal and presacral fat was nonspecific possibly from swelling versus tumor infiltration.  A few tiny indeterminate presacral lymph nodes were seen.  Preoperative endoscopic ultrasound June 11, 2009, demonstrated the tumor to be tunneling in nature, grossly ulcerated, and somewhat unusual for a standard rectal cancer.  The mass occupied 40% of the rectum.  No adenopathy was appreciated on EUS, but there was significant depth infiltration such that this would have likely been a T4 lesion in to the prostate if he had a prostate.  Therefore this mass was considered a locally advanced T3 lesion.
Mr. Schrimsher then underwent preoperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX in July and completing it in early October 2009.  He tolerated his chemotherapy well, with only one-week delay secondary to thrombocytopenia.  He had a restaging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis October 13, 2009, which showed a 1.3-cm indeterminate right adrenal nodule that was unchanged from comparison of June 4, 2009.  Mildly prominent mesenteric lymph nodes remained unchanged measuring 1.3 x 1.0-cm.  The liver remains clear of metastasis.  It specifically states there is no pulmonary nodule in the outside report.  Ashley Hospital radiology has reviewed this film and describes two tiny indeterminate nodules in the left lung and cyst series and two in the right lung.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy was appreciated.  Follow-up endoscopic ultrasound October 21, 2009, once again describes an ulcerated tumor 3-cm or so above the squamocolumnar junction occupying 50% of rectal lumen.  Once again no adenopathy was seen.  While no progression was observed, there was essentially no change in size.  Mr. Schrimsher met with Dr. Francis Johnson of Colon and Rectal Surgery in Tioga, and given the size of this tumor it was determined he may benefit from surgical resection with intraoperative radiation therapy given the risk for a-positive margin.  Therefore patient is now referred to Sunset Haven Valley Mental Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
Mr. Schrimsher's symptoms consist of fecal incontinence which is new since October of 2009.  He experiences occasional hematochezia, but is able to pass stool regularly every one-to-two days.  He notes no abdominal pain or rectal pain.  There is no nausea or vomiting.  He has been running a low-grade fever, believing he is up about a degree.  He is otherwise feeling fairly well from a GI standpoint.
Mr. Schrimsher has a history of prostate cancer.  He is status-post RRP in July of 2007 for a Gleeson score of 4+3=7 prostate adenocarcinoma involving bilateral prostate lobes with bilateral extraprostatic extension and bilateral seminal vesicle involvement, pathologically stage T3a-IIIB.  Perineural invasion was identified, but margins were negative as were two lymph nodes.  He has had subsequent urinary incontinence requiring the use of Depends.  His PSA was noted to rise approximately six-months postoperatively prompting beginning treatment with Lupron and ultimately received external-beam radiation March 24, 2008 through May 13, 2008 in 36 fractions, a total of 6,480 centigray.  Mr. Schrimsher's last PSA in September 2009 was 0 per patient report.  He continues with the urinary incontinence and would like to have consideration of surgical intervention for this at the time of his rectal cancer surgery.
Other comorbidities include COPD for which he uses a nebulizer four times daily.  When he can not use a nebulizer his symptoms responded well to Combivent.  He states he can walk two flights of stairs if he did not hurry.  He was hospitalized in December 2009 on steroids for a COPD exacerbation.  He started a dose of 160 mg then tapered off as of December 21, 2009.  He was hospitalized one other time over the past year for COPD exacerbation requiring a ten-day course of steroids.  He does not require oxygen therapy, and quit smoking around three years ago after a two pack-a-day history for 50 years.
Patient has a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia which has been evaluated elsewhere and origin is unknown.
Other comorbidities include hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis.  His methotrexate was discontinued in June 2009 and has not been resumed given his need for surgery.  He has no history of bleeding disorders, anesthesia reactions, thrombosis, sleep apnea, diabetes, heart attack or stroke.  He denies any chest pains or chest pressures.  He states he feels his balance has been off lately.  He states he was diagnosed with mild glaucoma; however, does not use medicines for this.
