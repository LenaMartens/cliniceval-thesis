Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative polypoid friable mass (5.5 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm) located 1.2 cm from the distal margin, which is histologically negative.  The tumor invades into but not through the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  A single hyperplastic polyp is identified 0.5 cm from the distal resection margin.  Multiple (19) diverticula are present.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (34) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B.  Colon, distal rectal ring/margin, excision:  Colonic mucosa, negative for dysplasia and tumor.
