Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with minimal treatment effect is identified forming an ulcerated mass (2.7 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm) located at the distal mucosal margin.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria. Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not identified.  Following resection of the distal margin (Part B), the final margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (5 of 14) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. [AJCC ypT2N2MX]

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal margin, re-excision:  Colorectal mucosa and squamous epithelium, negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid, rectum"" is a 31.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon and rectum with a 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm ulcerative mass located at the distal mucosal margin and 1.1 cm from the radial margin.  Deepest tumor invasion is 0.8 cm, and tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are present within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by HAZLETT.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""anus--final distal margin"" is a 5.0 cm in length portion of grossly unremarkable rectum and anus.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CRONIN.



Addendum Diagnosis
As requested, immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were performed on paraffin-embedded cancer tissue section (block A3).  The staining showed intact expression of all four enzymes.  These findings fail to provide evidence of HNPCC due to defective DNA mismatch repair .
