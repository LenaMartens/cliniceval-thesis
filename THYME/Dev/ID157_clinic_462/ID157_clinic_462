#1 Rectal cancer
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Evans, who also met with Mrs. Evan and her family.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient is scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, rectal ultrasound, and I have asked them to stage the lesion, tattoo below the lesion, and FNA if indicated.  I have also ordered colon and rectal surgeon and Medical and Radiation Oncology for their input as well.  I have asked for the outside CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis from March 5, 2010, to be evaluated here.  If patient were to come to surgery, she is having some new recent shortness-of-breath with lifting such as grocery bags, and I believe she would need something along the lines of a dobutamine stress echo.  Dr. Evans has kindly accepted seeing Mrs. Evan on Friday in my absence with a colon and rectal surgeon.  We should have the rectal ultrasound staging by that time.

#1 Rectal cancer
Mrs. Evan is a 56-year-old African-American female who had a-positive Hemoccult test.  This led to colonoscopy (report not in outside records).  Pathology has been read here showing tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia in the ascending colon, and rectal polyp showed invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma arising in a background of tubular adenoma.  Tumor extends to the deep biopsy margin.  This was Mrs. Evan' first colonoscopy.  She has been seen by a surgeon who thought transanal excision might be appropriate pending rectal ultrasound report.  Rectal ultrasound apparently showed a T2 lesion (again, no outside report included), and Mrs. Evan met with a surgeon, radiation and medical oncology through the Carl Hayden and Sports Chiropractic Clinic system in 75238.  The consensus was that the tumor board could not give a recommendation in regard to treatment, and she comes here for an opinion.
CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis March 5, 2010, shows bilateral axillary, mediastinal lymphadenopathy in addition to lymphadenopathy through the upper abdomen.  All of this has been seen on previous studies, the report states, and is most likely related to her sarcoidosis.  There are also multiple lymph nodes seen throughout each inguinal region, and no clearly defined focal colonic lesion.
