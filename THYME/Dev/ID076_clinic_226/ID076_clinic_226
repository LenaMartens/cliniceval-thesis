#1 Resected synchronous colon adenocarcinoma
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Dale Ahmad's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Pablo Lyle, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
As final pathology is not available at the time of this consultation, Dr. Lyle will be visiting with Mr. Wedgeworth either later on this afternoon or tomorrow to discuss formal treatment recommendations.  Pending those results and Mr. Wedgeworth's desire, we will make arrangements for evaluation with a return appointment.  He has verbalized understanding and is agreeable to the plan.
