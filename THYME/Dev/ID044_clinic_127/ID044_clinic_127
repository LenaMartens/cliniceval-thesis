Ms. Tilley is a pleasant 76-year-old woman who was found to have a cancer in the region of the splenic flexure.  The CT-scan does not show any evidence of metastatic disease.  Would recommend a segmental colectomy.  We plan on doing this open.  Discussed procedure, alternatives, and risks with the patient and answered all questions.
