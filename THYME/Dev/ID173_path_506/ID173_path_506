Final Diagnosis
A.  Ovary, left, oophorectomy:  Serous borderline tumor is identified forming a 9.0 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm cystic mass involving left fallopian tube and the surface of the left ovary.  Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.  Seen in consultation with Dr. Bobby D. Hicks.
With available surgical material [AJCC pT2aN0] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Rectum, low anterior resection:  Invase adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4), forming a 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm mass in the rectum.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria. Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (23) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
With available surgical material [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

C.  Uterus, right ovary and fallopian tube; hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy:  The right ovary shows a cystadenofibroma (0.7 cm in greatest dimension).  There is a benign endometrial polyp.  The right fallopian tube, cervix, myometrium, and portion of left fallopian tube are without diagnostic abnormality.

D.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Chronic cholecystitis with extensive mural calcification and cholelithiasis with multiple (17) mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) and sludge.  There is also a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm mixed stone impacted in the cystic duct.  A single cystic duct lymph node is benign.

E.  Lymph nodes, left pelvic external iliac, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (13) left pelvic external iliac lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

F.  Gonadal vein, left, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

G.  Lymph nodes, left pelvic common iliac, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (4) left pelvic common iliac lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

H.  Lymph nodes, left para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:  Multiple (7) left para-aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

I.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Without diagnostic abnormality.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""left ovary"" is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm ovary with a 9.0 x 5.5 cm fallopian tube.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface.  The fallopian tube is dilated with multiple excrescences within the lumen.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MENDOZA.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is a low anterior resection specimen consisting of 27.5 cm in length portion of rectum.  The distal margin is inked.  A 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 0.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 2.5 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the mucosa and the muscle.  There are also multiple (2) sessile polyps (averaging 0.2 cm in greatest dimension).   Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CUNNINGHAM.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""uterus, right ovary, right tube, and left tube"" is a 115.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and right ovary and cervix.  The uterine serosa is has focal fibrous adhesions.  The endometrium has a 2.2 x 1.2 cm sessile polyp in the posterior aspect.  There are no leiomyomata.  There is a 3.5 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm right ovary with a cystic and solid cut surface and a 9.5 cm in length right fallopian tube which has a diameter ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm.  There is also a 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of left fallopian tube which is unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by LANDRY.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is a 7.2 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm gallbladder with a 0.5 cm maximum wall thickness (in the fundus) and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is identified.  The fundus is completely calcified forming a 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm area which is filled with sludge and multiple (17) intact mixed stones (ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.9 in greatest dimension).  There is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm mixed stone impacted in the cystic duct, which is also calcified. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PRAHL.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""left external iliac nodes"" is a 5.2 x 4.9 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by CUNNINGHAM.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""left gonadal vein"" is a 7.5 cm in length by 0.8 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood vessel.  A representative section is submitted.  Grossed by MASON.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""left common iliac nodes"" is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by MENDOZA.

H.  Received fresh labeled ""left para-aortic nodes"" is a 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes.  All lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by MENDOZA.

I.  Received fresh labeled ""omentum"" is a 32.5 x 25.5 x 2.4 cm portion of omentum  No masses are identified grossly.  Lymph nodes are not identified.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MASON.
