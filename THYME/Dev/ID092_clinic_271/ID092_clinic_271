#1 Right colon cancer
The plan is laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.  I discussed with her the risks and benefits of the procedure, risks for infection, bleeding, anastomotic leak, open laparotomy, anesthetic problems.  She understands and wishes to proceed.  Consent has been signed for November 22 so would prefer not to be a first case for that day.

This is a 58-year-old female with biopsy-proven right colon cancer.  This was found during an evaluation for anemia.  Outside CT that has been read here shows cecal carcinoma with mildly prominent ileocolic mesenteric lymph node.  Otherwise, she is doing well.  She is on iron supplementation.  Her current hemoglobin is 10.3.  CEA is 2.1.  She does have a history of COPD and a phrenic nerve damaged from a left rotator cuff surgery.  Otherwise, healthy.
