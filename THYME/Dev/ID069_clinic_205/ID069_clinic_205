Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Terry Leblanc's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Moses Paik, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with Mrs. Castro's daughter that at this time unclear as to if we would offer chemotherapy or not.  It really depends on how Mrs. Castro heals.  Also important will be her mentation level at the time of her assessment.  Informed her that typically we like to reassess patient's in approximately four weeks' time.  At that time, I am only obtaining laboratory values.  If it is decided to go ahead with chemotherapy, would then obtain imaging studies.  Mrs. Castro's daughter states that they were very interested in returning in approximately four weeks' time to have more of a discussion regarding treatment options.  Daughter originally stated that she did not feel that chemotherapy would be an option they would choose, however they have agreed to return so that we can better assess Mrs. Castro.  She denies any further questions or concerns.  She has our telephone number to contact us should she have any further questions or concerns. Appointments will be arranged for a return in approximately four weeks' time.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Ready to learn. Learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan. The limitation is due to patient's mentation and hard of hearing.  To accommodate for this barrier, did speak louder as well as provide all the information to the patient's daughter who has power of attorney

Mrs. Castro is a 84 year-old woman who has slight dementia and resides in a nursing home.  We have been asked by Dr. Leblanc's surgical service to discuss treatment recommendations in the setting of a resected node-positive sigmoid colon cancer.  Mrs. Castro's history is as follows.
1.  She is presently residing in a nursing home due to dementia.  She was found to have melanotic stools and, subsequently, anemia.  Based on that, a colonoscopy was performed on May 26, 2010, which was only able to be advanced to 28 cm.  At that point, a mass was encountered that was not able to transverse.  Biopsies were positive for invasive moderately differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.
2.  June 14, 2010 - CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis negative for metastatic disease.
3.  June 22, 2010 - Again attempted a repeat colonoscopy.  At this time, was only able to advance to 30 cm.  They were not able to transverse the tumor.
4.  June 24, 2010 - Dr. Leblanc performed a resection of the sigmoid colon.  I do not have a copy of the operative report, however I do have pathology results which is positive for poorly-differentiated grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma noting an ulcerated and polypoid annular mass in the sigmoid colon.  Surgical resected margins are negative.  One of 20 regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (pT3, N1).
Today, Mrs. Castro is one-day postoperative.  She is sitting up in a chair in the Intensive Care Unit, not able to converse partially due to respiratory apparatus.  Daughter is present during this consultation.
