I explained to Mr. Buck and his wife carefully that it is a common recommendation to tell patients to continue with chemotherapy after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  It is our practice to recommend FOLFOX, but this is not based on the clinical trial but just in our day-to-day practice.  Unfortunately, we do not have a prospective randomized clinical trial that clearly defines if there is a role for FOLFOX or not after surgery.  He is young and otherwise very healthy so I think that it is reasonable to go back to an oxaliplatin-based regimen for four months, and he is agreeable.
We will start chemotherapy as soon as he has recovered from this, and then see him back two-weeks later.  I recommended to the patient not use masking tape and to consult the ostomy nurses.

I saw Mr. Buck in follow-up, a delightful 52-year-old male from New York North Versailles, who presented with a T3, N1 rectal cancer and received preoperative radiation therapy concurrently with 5-FU and oxaliplatin as per a clinical trial.  There was minimal residual submucosal disease in the surgical specimen, and no evidence of metastasis in any of the resected lymph nodes.  The patient underwent a LAR with a temporary colostomy.
Mr. Buck is recovering from surgery without complications at this point, although he required a long hospitalization, almost two-weeks, due to a slow return of bowel function.  He is having some problems with the adhesive tape in the colostomy.  He has chosen to use masking tape applied to the skin, and this is causing irritation of the area where the tape is applied.
The patient developed mild numbness and tingling in the tip of fingers and toes made worse by cold weather while receiving oxaliplatin, but this has resolved.
The medications for the most are unremarkable.
