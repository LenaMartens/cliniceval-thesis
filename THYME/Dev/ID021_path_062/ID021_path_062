Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, extended right hemicolectomy:  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma forming a 3.7 x 2.2 x 0.8 ulcerated mass in the ascending colon, located 9.7 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  The attached portion of omentum is negative for tumor.  Multiple (57) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
