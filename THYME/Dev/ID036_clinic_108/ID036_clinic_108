PLAN BY SYSTEMS
1. Neurological:  Continue to follow neurological exam.  Hydromorphone for pain control.  Continue escitalopram.
2. Pulmonary:  Clinically oxygenating and ventilating well.  Encourage good pulmonary toilet.
3. Cardiovascular:  Acceptable hemodynamics.  Intravascularly, she is not in excess.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Overall descent perfusion.  It is surprising with her significant coronary artery disease that she is not on a beta-blocker; however, it would appear this has been discontinued because of hypotension.  She is to receive a 3 L fluid pull today, which I think is appropriate.
4. Renal:  Dialysis per Nephrology.  As mentioned earlier, 3 L fluid pull tonight which is appropriate.  Postdialysis labs in the morning.
5. Gastrointestinal:  NPO for this evening.  Advance diet as tolerated with return of bowel function.  Continue intermittent suction on her NG tube.
6. Infectious disease:  No active issues.  She should be receiving periprocedural cefazolin with an appropriate stop date.  She is also on metronidazole.
7. Endocrine:  She is on low-dose prednisone which appears to be a chronic medication for her.  We will continue this.  Continue simvastatin.  She is also covered with insulin.
8. Hematological:  Transfused to keep her hemoglobin above 8 g/dL.  TEDs, SCDs, and subcutaneous heparin in place.  She is also on an aspirin.
9. Access:  She has her dialysis catheter which has been intermittently used for IVs.  I think this is not a great option.  Tonight, she has peripheral access which is poor.  We will place a foot IV, and I think she should get a PICC line, at least while she is hospitalized.
10. Social:  I spoke to the patient, updating her as to the plan of care.

We have been asked to see this Ashdown-year-old Caucasian female by Dr. Billy Langley for evaluation and management of cardiopulmonary systems status-post left hemicolectomy and ileosigmoid anastomosis for sigmoid cancer.  The available history including the intraoperative course has been reviewed.
I have seen and evaluated the patient and reviewed the pertinent imaging and laboratory data.  I discussed the patient's care with the critical care house staff as well as nursing.  Please refer to the resident's note of today's date for additional details.

Mrs. Duran is an Ashdown-year-old Caucasian female with an abundance of medical problems including depression, restless legs, hypertension, coronary artery disease with a-positive DSE (November 2008 with an ischemic threshold of 109 beats per minute), diastolic heart dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on dialysis who was admitted July 16, 2010, with fevers and chills concerning for healthcare-associated pneumonia.  She was eventually found to have a right segmental pulmonary emboli, splenic infarct, and anemia.  Further workup of her anemia showed a colonic mass in the descending colon.
On August 4, 2010, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a left hemicolectomy and ileosigmoid anastomosis.  From a surgical standpoint, there were no complications.  Anesthetically, the procedure was performed under a general endotracheal anesthetic.  There were no respiratory complications during the case.  Her hemodynamics were mildly labile but were generally on the normotensive side.  Her resuscitation was quite mild, requiring no units of packed red blood cells.  The estimated blood loss was minimal.  She was extubated, had an uneventful recovery room course.
She comes to the intensive care unit for further resuscitation and cardiovascular monitoring purposes.
