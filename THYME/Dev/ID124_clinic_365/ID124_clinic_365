#1 Resected cecal adenocarcinoma with resection of liver metastasis
Prior to meeting with Mr. Lofton, I have had the opportunity to review his past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  I have also had the opportunity to review this case in its entirety with Dr. Vasquez, my collaborating provider, who is in agreement with our plan.  Dr. Vasquez also was kind enough to visit with the patient directly.  After extensive discussion informing Mr. Lofton that we do not see any evidence of any disease recurrence, at this time have no data to support whether or not he should receive adjuvant therapy.  After an extensive discussion, it was decided that he would proceed with observation only with repeating imaging in approximately three-months' time at which time further discussion can be had regarding need for future treatment.  Patient states full understanding and agreement with this plan.  I am not making a formal return appointment due to the fact that patient is going to be following-up with his local provider.

Mr. Lofton is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman from Windsor Locks, Connecticut.  I am seeing him today for his first follow-up after undergoing resection of his cecal cancer and liver metastasis.  For comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated February 23, 2010.  Briefly his history is as follows:
1.  June 30, 2009:  Due to change in stool, patient underwent colonoscopy noting mass in the right colon.  Biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.
2.  July 7, 2009:  CT abdomen and pelvis noting ill-defined cecal mass, multiple hepatic lesions.
3.  July 14, 2009:  PET/CT positive activity in the mass of the cecum and multiple lesions within the liver.  Subsequently the patient was evaluated by a surgeon and was informed he was not a surgical candidate due to location of the lesions.  CEA elevated at 82.
4.  July 28, 2009, through November 2009:  Treated with ten cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy.  Withheld Avastin due to concerns of bleeding from primary tumor.  CT scans performed in September and subsequently in November noted stable disease and then secondly a decrease in the liver lesions.  Repeat colonoscopy documented a decrease in the size of the tumor.
5.  December 2009 through February 16, 2010:  Continued with 5-FU leucovorin therapy for a total of five additional treatments.  Oxaliplatin was discontinued due to vertigo and hearing changes.  CEA in January was 2.0.  CT-scan also performed in January noting stable liver disease.
6.  February 24, 2010, Dr. Nicely and Dr. Powell performed abdominal exploration with a right hemicolectomy and subsegmentectomy of sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII of the liver.  Also cholecystectomy performed.  Pathology of the right hemicolectomy tissue positive for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  All surgical resected margins are negative.  Of 36 regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for metastatic disease.  Two additional tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia were identified in the ascending colon.  Pathology from the liver resected tissue noted that two of the seven samples noted marked treatment effect with no definite evidence of viable tumor.  Remaining five samples noted residual disease with a fibrotic background with treatment effect.
Today, Mr. Lofton states that he feels extremely well.  He reports that since his hospitalization he has been having improvement in his bowel function.  He reports that he does fluctuate between constipation and diarrhea although this is improving. He denies any blood or mucus in his stool.  He reports that he had a poor appetite at first but that has now returned to normal.  His weight has been pretty much stable since his hospital dismissal.  During his hospitalization, he did develop tachycardia and was started on a beta-blocker.  Reports his incisional site did take quite a time to heal especially the area where his belt buckle would rub.  He does continue to experience neuropathy in his fingers and toes, mainly in the tips of both.  He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, elevated temperature.
