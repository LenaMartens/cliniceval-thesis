Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:  Invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 1.7 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm ulcerated mass, located 9.8 cm from the distal resection margin.  The tumor invades the submucosa.  A separate tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia (1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm) is located 6.0 cm from the distal resection margin and a separate tattooed area consistent with prior biopsy site is identified located 4.1 cm from the distal resection margin. The proximal and distal surgical resection margins are negative tumor. A single (of 36) regional lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Colon, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable colonic mucosa identified.

C.  Rectum, proximal anastomotic ring, excision:  Grossly unremarkable rectal mucosa identified.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum, sigmoid colon"" is a  resection specimen consisting of 38.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon.  A 1.7 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm ulcerated mass with raised edges is present within the rectum, 9.8 cm from the distal mucosal margin and 6.0 cm from the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass is confined to the mucosa.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Additionally, there is a 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm pedunculated polyp 6.0 cm from the distal margin and a separate tattooed area consistent with prior biopsy site located 4.1 cm from distal margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by RONDEAU.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""distal anastomotic ring"" is a 2.7 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm portion of bowel.  Gross only.  Grossed by ADAMS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""proximal anastomotic ring"" is a 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm portion of bowel.  Gross only.  Grossed by ADAMS.
