Final Diagnosis
A.  Liver, segment VI, resection:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma with therapy related changes, completely excised.

B.  Liver and gallbladder, segmental resection and cholecystectomy:  Multiple (10) masses of metastatic adenocarcinoma ranging in size from 0.2 x 2.8 cm, with extensive therapy related changes.  A single mass grossly extends to the resection margin.  Gallbladder is grossly unremarkable.  

C.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Grade 2 (of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming multiple (2) foci; focus intramucosal adenocarcinoma measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and another focus of residual invasive adenocarcinoma within the pericolonic adipose tissue.  A single (1 of 58) regional lymph nodes is positive for adenocarcinoma.  

D.  Rectum, distal anastomotic ring:  Grossly unremarkable 0.9 cm segment of distal rectal anastomotic ring.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT3N1M1] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
