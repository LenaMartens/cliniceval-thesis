#1 Colon cancer
See History of Present Illness.  Discussed with Dr. Swanson who also met with Mrs. Castro and her family.  Please see his supervisory note.  Patient scheduled for blood work, chest x-ray, ECG, CT  abdomen and pelvis, and I will see her back with those results.  We may wish to try to avoid surgical intervention and think possibly of stenting of this lesion, but we will wait for CT-scan.  She is scheduled on June 22 for complex colonoscopy with anesthesia assistance and also on June 23 Colon and Rectal Surgery consultation.   Patient is not okay at this juncture.  She was seen by a cardiologist in Idyllwild back in April when she was hospitalized and had an adenosine  sestamibi scan after that hospitalization, but if surgery is contemplated I would wish her to be seen by cardiology.

#1 Colon cancer
Mrs. Castro is an Guilford-year-old female who resides in a nursing home.  She was found to have anemia, melena, and was transfused.  Attempt at colonoscopy May 26, 2010, got to 28 cm where a mass was encountered.  Preparation was poor and apparently the colonoscope could not be passed beyond this mass.  Outside pathology has been read here showing invasive moderately differentiated grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  Patient now comes to Natchitoches Parish Clinic for further evaluation of the above.  Mrs. Castro is somewhat demented, but states that her bowel movements have not changed.
