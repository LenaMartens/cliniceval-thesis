#1 Transverse colon mass, probable adenocarcinoma
The radiographic features, the clinical symptoms of the pain, and the degree of anemia suggest that this is a locally advanced lesion.  In the absence of obvious distant metastases, the next step would be to perform colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and tap to the lesion site.  We will then proceed with consolation from colorectal surgery.

Mrs. Morrell described intermittent back and mid-abdominal discomfort in recent weeks, associated with episodic vomiting.  She has not seen any gross rectal blood or noticed significant change in her bowel pattern.  Her weight has dropped approximately 5 pounds in the past two-to-three months, and her appetite is slightly diminished.  A CT-scan of the abdomen demonstrated an apparent mass with associated regional adenopathy in the distal transverse colon.  The liver appeared normal radiographically, and liver enzymes were normal as ordered by Dr. Borrego.  The patient has had a stable hemoglobin of around 14 through the years, but this dropped to its current 9.5 since October.
