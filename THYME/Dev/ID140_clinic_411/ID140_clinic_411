#1 Treatment recommendations for recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Ball through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor, and potential side-effects which include, but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts, and risk of infection.

Mrs. Caleb Johnson is a pleasant 50-year-old woman from Donnybrook.  We are seeing her today to discuss treatment recommendations for recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma.  Her history is as follows:
1.  May 13, 2008:  Presented to her local facility due to rectal bleeding and severe, acute abdominal discomfort.  Workup included an ultrasound, which noted intra-abdominal collection with formation of abscess.  There was evidence of a growth within the sigmoid colon.  Felt that she had perforated her bowel.  Biopsies obtained were positive for intra-abdominal pus.  Subsequently underwent endoscopy, which noted a fungating mass at the rectosigmoid area (do not have a copy of that report).
2.  June 15, 2008:  Underwent low-anterior resection, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resection of the dome of the bladder as well as a temporary colostomy.  Per operative report, there was no evidence of any liver metastasis.  There was a large mesenteric lymph node.  Also evidence of invasion of the anterior abdominal wall, small-bowel to part of the jejunum and ileum, ovaries, uterus, omentum, and bladder.  Pathology of the tissue was positive for adenocarcinoma, grade 2/3, infiltrating the serosa with pericolonic invasion to the bladder and uterus.  Omentum was noted to be negative.  Four (of 15) lymph nodes involved with metastatic disease.  Omentum was noted to be negative.
3.  November 15, 2008:  Completed six-months of adjuvant chemotherapy of oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
4.  January 31, 2009, through March 9, 2009:  Underwent radiation therapy, receiving a total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.
5.  January 12, 2010:  Patient continued to be observed with imaging studies and scoping, which were all negative.  At this time, it was decided to proceed with reversal of her colostomy.  Unfortunately, during this procedure, patient was noted to have a thickened area of fibrosis in the pelvis, which was biopsied and found to be positive for adenocarcinoma.  Postoperative course was complicated with a DVT and pulmonary embolism.  Presently is on anticoagulation therapy.  Patient's brother reports that they were then subsequently seen by an oncologist, who stated that she was not a surgical candidate and would recommend chemotherapy only.  Patient is presenting to KMC for another opinion regarding treatment.
Mrs. Caleb Johnson states that her appetite has been fair.  She previously weighed approximately 90 kg before her first surgery and is presently 79 kg.  She reports that her appetite is down since her last surgery.  Reports that she has early satiety.  States that if she overeats, she then has an emesis.  Energy level has been declining.  Uses a wheelchair for long distances.  She does continue to experience pain with a deep breath.  She also has a persistent discomfort on the left-side of her abdomen that is stimulated by activity.  Reports that when she is sitting still, there is no pain.  With activity, the pain can intensify to a 5 to 6 on a-1 to 10 pain scale.  States that it does not impact her ability to sleep.  She is up three-to-four times a night needing to urinate.  She states that this is due to her history of diabetes, also, the issue that her bladder is much smaller at this time.  Since her last surgery, she has been experiencing some secretions from her rectum, which are white in color.  She reports that her ostomy output has been stable.  Denies any blood or mucus in that output.  Has had some complications with her ostomy site, stating occasional times with appliance failure, rupture.  She does have residual neuropathy in her hands and feet after her last chemotherapy treatment.  States that after experiencing the DVT, it had worsened in the left leg.  States that she presently has tingling in that leg most of the time.  She denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
