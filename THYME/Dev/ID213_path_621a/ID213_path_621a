Final Diagnosis
A.	Colon, ascending total abdominal colectomy:  Invasive, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a 8.5 x 5.1 x 1.3 cm circumferential mass in the right colon, 25 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Perineural invasion is present.  Lymphatic invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (4) sessile serrated adenoma as well as multiple (3) tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia are identified in the ascending, transverse, and sigmoid colon, ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.6 cm.  Previous biopsy site changes present.  A single hyperplastic polyp is also identified in the sigmoid colon.  Multiple (27) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

B.	Rectum, anus, excision:  Multiple (10) tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia and hyperplastic polyps are identified, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in the rectum.  The anus is without diagnostic abnormality.

Gross Description
A.	Received fresh labeled total abdominal colon is a total colectomy specimen consisting of 87 cm of colon. A 8.5 x 5.1 x 1.3 cm ulcerative polypoid annular mass is present within the right colon, 25 cm from the ileocecal valve. Grossly the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 25 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  There are multiple polyps 0.4 to 1.6 cm with associated previous biopsy site changes.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by KNAPP

B.	Received fresh labeled rectum, anus is a 13.8 cm segment of rectum with attached 3.9 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm anus.  There are approximately 10 polyps in the rectum, 0.2 - 0.4 cm, two nodules of fat necrosis in the perirectal tissue, and 2 prominent anal papillae.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WHITWORTH.





Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.	Colon, total abdominal colectomy:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in the right colon forming a circumferential mass measuring 8.5 x 5.1 x 1.3 cm mass (located  25 cm from the ileocecal valve).  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic soft tissues.  Multiple  tubular adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas identified.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, the nearest margin (proximal) is free by 25 cm.

B.	Rectum, anus, excision:  Multiple tubular adenomas and hyperplastic polyps in the rectum,.  The anus is without diagnostic abnormality.
