#1 Right colon cancer
I had a long discussion with the patient and his wife in regard to the nature of the disease and the planned course of action.  I would recommend a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy.  I then discussed with him the nature of the operation and the risks associated with it.  I discussed with him the risk of possible anastomotic leak which I quoted him as being 1% to 2%.  We also discussed the risk of needing a temporary stoma if there was a leak.  The main risks discussed with him was wound infection.  Other risks discussed included inability to do it laparoscopically, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and possible need for blood transfusion.  The patient agreed to a blood transfusion if needed.  We also discussed the risks of possible need for chemotherapy.  The risk of an acute cardiopulmonary event were also discussed, and the patient wishes to be considered a full code.  After all this discussion, the patient agreed to proceed with surgery.  He was listed for a laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy.  We will schedule a CT-scan and CEA.  I also discussed this with his recovering cardiologist who will clear him for surgery.

Mr. Kelly is a 68-year-old gentleman who seven years ago underwent a heart transplant.  He was here for a screening colonoscopy which I performed this morning.  At the time of the colonoscopy, I discovered what appeared to be a very malignant-appearing lesion in the region of the ileocecal valve.  Multiple biopsies were sent.  Pathology contacted me and informed me that they were consistent with malignant signet cell carcinoma.  The patient's past surgical history is notable for an appendectomy.
