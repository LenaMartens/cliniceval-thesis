Final Diagnosis
A.  Abdominal colon, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated, 5.1 x 3.6 x 1.6 cm mass in the cecum, at the ileocecal valve.  The carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria to involve the subserosal adipose tissue.  Angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  A separate invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified arising in a 5.1 x 4.6 x 0.7 cm tubulovillous adenoma in the transverse colon, 38 cm from the carcinoma in the cecum.  The carcinoma invades into the muscularis propria only.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (7) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia as well as a sessile serrated adenoma (present in the proximal right colon) are also identified, ranging in size from 0.6 to 2.4 cm.  Multiple (10) colonic diverticula are also identified in the left side of the colon.  The appendix and the terminal ileum are unremarkable.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified in multiple (7 of 20) regional lymph nodes. AJCC pT3N2b, 7th ed.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""abdominal colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 1.6 cm of terminal ileum, 106.0 cm of colon, and a 4.5 x 0.6 cm appendix.  A 5.1 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm polypoid mass is present within the 2.5 cm, from the ileal mucosal margins.  Tumor perforation is absent.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  There is also a polypoid 5.1 x 4.6 x 1.1 cm mass located in the distal transverse colon, 38 cm from the cecal tumor mass and 26 cm from the rectal mucosal margin.  Multiple (8) polyps identified, ranging from 0.6 to 2.4 cm.  Multiple (10) diverticuli are present.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LANE.



Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Abdominal colon, resection:  Grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma is identified forming 2 masses - a 5.1 x 3.6 x 1.6 cm cecal mass (2.5 cm to ileocecal valve) invading into pericolic soft tissue and a 5.1 x 4.6 x 0.7 cm transverse colon mass (38 cm from cecal mass) invading into muscularis propria.  Multiple polyps and lymph nodes are grossly identified.  Hold for permanent sections.
