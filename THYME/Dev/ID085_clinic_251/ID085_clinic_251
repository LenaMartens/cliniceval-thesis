IMPRESSION
#1 Sigmoid colon cancer with likely metastasis to the liver
Discussed that her liver lesion is likely metastatic from her sigmoid colon cancer which is likely the primary.  She will need a colon surgery to treat this, and often times we can do an isolated liver resection.  We will need to have her see one of our liver surgeon.  She will see Dr. Jean Wilson in surgical consultation this afternoon.  We have not had a recent proximal colon evaluation as she had her recent colonoscopy performed to the transverse colon, and the lesion has not been tattooed.  We will have her outside CT-scan reviewed here and her liver MRI.  I will get a CEA blood test and liver function tests. We will get a staging chest x-ray as she has not had one for over a couple months to make sure there are no lung lesions. Discussed her children and siblings need to have screening colonoscopies at age 48.
#2 Uterine mass
We will have her outside pelvic ultrasound reviewed here.  We will have her see one of our gynecologic surgeons for further evaluation.  This is not likely related to her sigmoid cancer with likely metastatic disease to the liver.
#3 PMR
At this point she feels she is stable.  She is not wanting an opinion here.  Will not change her medications.
#4 Hypothyroidism
Stable.
She was seen with her husband.  I will see her with Dr. Wilson later this afternoon.  Reviewed over 40 pages of outside medical records.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
Code status:  Discussed with Mrs. Register.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Register is a 58-year-old female from Eau Claire, accompanied by her husband for an opinion regarding surgical treatment for her cancer and for an evaluation of a uterine abnormality.
Mrs. Register reports a 5-plus year history of rectal bleeding.  She had her first colonoscopy in June 2005 for evaluation and had an EGD for GERD symptoms.  In reviewing her report, she had a-1-cm ileocecal valve polyp that was removed and a-1-cm midascending colon polyp that was removed. These appeared to be hyperplastic polyps, and it was recommended she return for a colonoscopy in three years.  In regard to her EGD, she had two small fundic gland polyps, less than 5-mm. She also noticed about five years ago having minor fecal seepage or mucus seepage.  A follow-up colonoscopy was performed on February 9, 2009, which was normal. Over the last six-months she has had significant weight-loss, going from a size 16 to a size 4. Her appetite has significantly decreased.  She has been a little more nauseated but has not vomited. When she eats a heavy meal she will have a left shoulder "ache" that will last a while, which has been occurring for 3 years. If she eats normally it doesn't occur.  She has had a mild abdominal and pelvic tenderness since her pelvic ultrasound (discussed above). This rates a 4 today but generally she only takes Tylenol Extra-Strength once-a-week and she does not feel she needs additional pain medication.  She has been more fatigued. She has noticed worsening of her fecal leakage problem and has had hematochezia since Fall 2009.  She recently underwent an updated colonoscopy on July 13, 2010, which was only performed to the transverse colon due to discomfort. At 25 cm a circumferential sigmoid cancer was noted and biopsied but not tattooed. The pathology slides have been reviewed here and revealed invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma. No family history of colorectal cancer.  For the last six-months she has had mostly watery, mucousy, and bloody stools. In reviewing her outside records she had stool cultures performed which were negative. She did not have C Dif tested however. She attributes some of her weight-loss to the fact that she has been on chronic prednisone for three years for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). She is currently on 1-mg and she has been down to this dose for the last month but for the last three years has not been able to get off it completely. She was on methotrexate but stopped this a month ago due to concerns regarding her liver (discussed below). She had a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on June 8, 2010 and we be having this reviewed.  This did not reveal evidence of the sigmoid cancer per local report.  However, they found a large hepatic cyst in the right liver lobe of the liver and a worrisome 1.7-cm lesion in the left liver lobe that is concerning for a malignancy. She also had fluid mixed with hyperdense material within the uterine cavity without lymphadenopathy which was also worrisome.  An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 3- x 2.5-cm solid, hypoechoic mass within the left hepatic lobe concerning for a metastatic lesion as she was diagnosed with sigmoid cancer. A liver MRI was recommended, which she had on Friday, July 30, which has not been read locally, which we will plan to review here.  She has not had CEA testing.  Regarding her uterine abnormality on CT, a pelvic ultrasound was performed on July 27, 2010, revealing a 3.5-cm heterogenous solid lobulated mass throughout the central aspect of the uterus.  Possible differential diagnoses mentioned included atypical fibroids, endometrial carcinoma, or a sarcoma with endometrial biopsy was recommended or pelvic MRI.  After her pelvis ultrasound last week she has started having vaginal spotting each day, a little bit of bright-red blood.  She did not have bleeding prior to the ultrasound. No family history of uterine cancer.  She has a sister who has stage IV breast cancer at age 58 which is thought to be a hormone-sensitive breast cancer.  She had two vaginal deliveries.  She had a Pap performed on May 14, 2010, which was negative, and she was screened annually prior to this.  She has a distant history of an abnormal Pap many years ago.
She and her husband are here at Milwaukee University of Iowa Family Care Center to determine whether what is going on in the uterus is related to her colon cancer and which is the primary and what to do about the liver lesion and the uterine abnormality.  They have talked to the cancer providers in Brandamore, and it was mentioned if her case became complicated and if more than a sigmoid resection was needed that possibly Florence may pay for her to have surgery here. She has not yet met with a surgeon in Florence as many of them are on vacation at this time but she has a tentative surgical date at-home on September 1, this is only for the sigmoid resection, and she has a meeting date in mid-August with the surgeon. She has a appointment set-up at-home to meet with a gynecologist too, regarding her uterine issues.
Of note, in reviewing her outside records, in May 2009, she had an elevated total bilirubin and a mildly elevated GGT.  Her most recent labs were in May and included liver function tests (AST, ALT, alk-phos) which were normal.  Her most recent blood work was performed on July 22, only a CBC.  Their lab uses different results for the hemoglobin.  Their range is 120 to 160.  She is at 141.  Hematocrit was 0.41, and for them 0.35 to 0.47 is normal so she is actually normal with a normal platelet count at 410 and a WBC count at 10.3 which is normal per their lab.  She has not needed blood transfusions.
