Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, portion of sigmoid, resection:  Poorly differentiated (grade 3 of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 4.3 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm ulcerated and polypoid annular mass in the sigmoid colon, located 4.2 cm from the closest mucosal resection margin.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A single (1 of 20) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
