#1 Recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma, previously resected node-negative
Prior to meeting with Mr. Palmer, I have had the opportunity to review his past medical records, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  I have also had the opportunity to review this case in its entirety with his primary oncologist, Dr. Hubbard as well as with Dr. Price of the Colorectal Surgery Department.  At this time, we would like to further evaluate the liver lesions due to the fact that ultrasound did not see the lesions but feel that they continue to be indeterminate.  Therefore, after much discussion, it was decided to proceed with MRI scan for further delineation of this region.  Biopsy would be questionable in this situation due to the fact that he has a very small lesion.  He is scheduled to undergo simulation today.  I will be contacting the radiologists to let them know of our desire to further evaluate the liver before proceeding with such a heroic surgical procedure.  Patient stated full understanding and agreement with this plan.  I will see him back once MRI scan is completed.  He denies any further questions or concerns.

Mr. Palmer is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman from Pueblo.  I am seeing him today to follow-up with results of a recent ultrasound evaluation of his liver for an individual with a history of resected rectal adenocarcinoma with local recurrence.  For a comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated August 24, 2010.  His history is as follows:
1.  September 2008:  Colonoscopy noting a mass 5 to 7-cm within the rectum.  Biopsy was inconclusive.  After re-review of the tissue, it was then noted to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
2.  September 10, 2008:  CT-scan noting an asymmetric soft-tissue prominence in the rectal wall, right of midline.
3.  September 29, 2008, through November 3, 2008:  Treated on clinical trial NSABP R-04 receiving infusional 5-FU and oxaliplatin in conjunction with radiation therapy.
4.  December 18, 2008:  Low-anterior resection with a diverting ileostomy performed elsewhere.  Tissue was positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin production.  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria to involve the perirectal fat.  Three mesenteric nodules of metastatic carcinoma are present, not able to identify these as lymph nodes; negative surgical resected margins, closest was radial margin, 1-cm.
5.  February 2009 through March 2009:  Treated with three cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy with Neulasta support.
6.  March 19, 2009:  Colostomy reversal.
7.  April 6, 2009, through August 3, 2009:  Completed 12 cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy with cycles 10, 11, and 12 without oxaliplatin due to neuropathy; continue to use Neulasta to support blood counts.
8.  April 6, 2010:  Prior to this time, patient had undergone colonoscopies and repeat scans, all negative.  At this time, patient noted air in with his urine.  CT-scan was negative for metastatic disease.
9.  April 22, 2010:  Cystoscopy noting abnormal erythema of the bladder mucosa, moderate bilobar prostate hypertrophy.  May 17, 2010, repeat cystoscopy again noting abnormal bladder mucosa.
10.  June 4, 2010:  Colonoscopy noted inflammation in the rectum around the anastomosis, questioning possible fistula.
11.  June 7, 2010:  Cystoscopy with bladder biopsies which one was noted to have moderate urothelial dysplasia.
12.  June 11, 2010:  Patient underwent Proctofoam administration into the rectum.
13.  August 24, 2010:  Presented to Walthall for further work-up due to the fact that he had air again in his urine with severe groin pain.
14.  August 23, 2010:  CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed at Walthall noting two low-density lesions in the liver which are indeterminate; diffuse soft-tissue density in front of the lower portion of the sacrum.
15.  August 25, 2010:  A CT-guided biopsy of presacral mass was negative for malignancy.
16.  August 27, 2010:  Underwent colonoscopy with EUS with biopsy and fine-needle aspirate.  Presacral area contained a large, hypoechoic, infiltrative mass that was biopsy positive for malignancy, adenocarcinoma.  Biopsy of the rectum notes superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia, focal high-grade dysplasia, and ulceration.
Today, Mr. Palmer states that the pain that he has been experiencing in the past continues to intensify.  Reports that he takes anywhere from five to six OxyContin (5-mg) immediate-release tablets in a day.  He states that he does feel a bit more fatigued on this medication.  He reports that his bowels have been moving normally.  For further evaluation, please refer to the previous subsequent visit notes on August 24 and September 14.
