#1 T3, N0, M0, rectal carcinoma
I talked to him about standard treatment with radiation therapy and 5-FU and the requirement of a PICC line.  I then discussed treatment on protocol R-04 and discussed that half of the patient's receive 5-FU and have received Xeloda.  In addition, half of each of those groups gets oxaliplatin and the other half does not.

PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Dr. Miller is 65 years old.
1.  Two-month history of rectal bleeding.  This led to colonoscopy February 19, 2010, at Western Mental County Memorial Hospital West.  A large polyp in the rectum was found, and a small polyp in the sigmoid.  The endoscopist made it to the cecum, and there were no other abnormalities.  The rectal lesion was found to be an adenocarcinoma, grade 3.  The sigmoid polyp as a tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
2.  Patient seen in Gastroenterology as well by Dr. Pritchett.  Because of the large endoscopic lesion, endoscopic ultrasound was done.  One node which was 6-mm in maximum size was found.  It was felt it was a T3 lesion.  Dr. Pritchett preferred the patient receive neoadjuvant treatment.
3.  Patient seen by Dr. Stacey Holub from Radiation Oncology who agreed with the plan for neoadjuvant treatment.
4.  Patient referred to Medical Oncology.
Patient feels well.  He has no new problems.  He has overall been in good health.
