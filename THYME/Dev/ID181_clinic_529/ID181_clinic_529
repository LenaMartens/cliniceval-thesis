#1 Colon cancer, grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma
#2 Emphysema
As Mr. Blom's colonoscopy was incomplete as they could not go past the splenic flexure due to the mass, we will proceed with a repeat colonoscopy to try to assess the proximal colon, and if that is unsuccessful, he will go on to CT colonography.  Also, complete the colorectal cancer staging evaluation including basic laboratory workup, CEA, a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  We will also proceed with PFTs since he has a history of extensive smoking and personal history of emphysema.
#3 Dysphagia
Patient has reported dysphagia in the last few weeks with a pill he has taken for the last few years.  However, he denies any solid or liquid dysphagia, so with that, we will proceed with an EGD.  Of note, he has not taken his aspirin for several weeks.
#4 Personal history of a lung nodule
Patient reports that he has a history of a lung nodule that is unremarkable and has been worked-up in the past in New Jersey by pulmonologists.  This will be seen on chest CT most likely.  The above was discussed with Ms. Shaw and Dr. Fenley, and they agree with what is discussed above.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Mr. Blom is a 77-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma of the colon at the splenic flexure and is here for further evaluation.  Mr. Blom has been suffering from anorexia, fatigue, and weight-loss over the last year.  He reports that he has lost about 15 pounds.  When he went in for evaluation in May of 2010, they noted he had anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.9, but none of his other lab work was grossly abnormal.  He went for a colonoscopy, which was done June 11, 2010, and this revealed a partially obstructing mass at the splenic flexure as well as diverticulosis.  Pathology was reviewed here and revealed invasive grade 3 (out of 4) adenocarcinoma.  He denies any melena, hematochezia, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, night sweats, or other symptoms unless previously noted.
