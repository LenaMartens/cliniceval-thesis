Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an exophytic and ulcerated mass (7.2 x 4.1 x 0.6 cm) located in the ascending colon, 6.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Adenocarcinoma invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (24) regional lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

AJCC pT3N0, 7th ed.

B. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  An adenomyoma in the fundus of the gall bladder (1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm).  Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (a single cholesterol stone, 1.3 cm in greatest dimension).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""ileum, cecum, ascending, and portion of transverse colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 4.5 cm of terminal ileum, 28.0 cm of colon, and a 7.0 x 1.3 cm appendix.  A 7.2 x 4.1 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass is present within the ascending colon, 6.2 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 17.2 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by BIRCH.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is an 8.8 x 3.8 x 2.1 cm gallbladder with a 0.7 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  A single cholesterol stone (1.3 cm in greatest dimension) is identified.  There is a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm thickened wall mass on the dome of the fundus.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by UTSEY.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Stanley Smith, PCR-based testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) will be performed on right colon cancer tissue sections (block S2); when completed, results will be available in BJVH QstfIhmt.
