#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma (T2, N2, M1 [positive left periaortic lymph node])
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Taylor's service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Harrington, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
I have carefully explained to Mr. Bradley his situation.  He is somewhat hesitant about entertaining the idea of chemotherapy, but has decided to return in the outpatient setting for further discussion regarding the situation.  I have emphasized the need to make contact with a local medical oncologist to ensure continuity of care.  For his appointment with us in a month, I have ordered a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, and an evaluation by us in Medical Oncology.  He verbalized understanding and is agreeable to returning.

Mr. Bradley is a very pleasant 73-year-old male from New York, Glidden  I was asked to visit with him by Dr. Taylor's service for postoperative education purposes.
Mr. Bradley has a prior past surgical history significant for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure      (EF 37%), and insulin-dependent diabetes.
1.  January 2010 - presented locally with progressive shortness-of-breath and was noted to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 7.8.
2.  January 29, 2010 - colonoscopy showed a circumferential lesion at the proximal side of the splenic flexure.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  CT imaging showed a 2.7-cm periaortic lymph node as well as questionable retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  There was no evidence of other disease in the liver or lung.
3.  February 19, 2010 - taken for a segmental colon resection as well as a resection of the left periaortic lymph node by Dr. Taylor.  Per the operative note, there were enlarged palpable lymph nodes lateral to the aortic and inferior to the region of the left splenic vein, as well as extensive inflammatory rind around this area somewhat stuck to the aorta, 95% removed.  Surgical pathology: colon, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 5.7-cm x 5.5-cm x 2.2-cm mass invading the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  There were negative surgical margins, and 4 of 34 regional lymph nodes were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Left periaortic lymph nodes were positive for metastatic poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary.  The tumor was staged at a T3, N2, M1.
Mr. Bradley is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in a chair during our consultation today.
