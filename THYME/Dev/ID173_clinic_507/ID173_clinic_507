I reviewed everything with the patient.  Her blood work is unremarkable, save for mild hypokalemia.  Recommended that she take bananas to bring this up.  It is probably related to the fact that she is on hydrochlorothiazide.  I also reviewed her CT-scan, which shows no significant change.  She has an indeterminate lesion nodule in her right adrenal, which measures 1.4-cm.  There is minimal, if any, change from before when it measured 1.1-cm.  It is my feeling that we should continue to observe this.  It may be a benign adenoma.  From my perspective, we will see the patient again in three-months' time with blood work and CT-scan.

1.  She was in her usual state of health until March 2010, when she noticed increasing frequency of bowel movements and some blood per rectum.
2.  She underwent a colonoscopy at the end of May and was found to have a rectal tumor.
3.  Based on endoscopic ultrasound, it is a T2, possibly T3 lesion. There were hypoechoic nodes next to the primary tumor.
4.  The patient underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis on May 25, 2010, that showed very high suspicion for cystic ovarian malignancy with indeterminate, subcentimeter liver lesions and porcelain gallbladder. The liver lesions were followed with an MRI on June 3, 2010, which showed that these liver lesions are most likely to be hemangioma.  An ultrasound of the pelvis on June 3, 2010, showed large cystic mass in the left adnexa measuring 5 x 6-cm.
5.  She received five sessions of radiation therapy with a total of 2500 cGy, completed on June 25, 2010.
6.  On July 1, 2010, the patient underwent surgery in the form of proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy, right oophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, left pelvic lymphadenectomy, left para-aortic lymphadenectomy, omentectomy, and cholecystectomy.  Pathology revealed serous borderline tumor involving the left ovary, 9 x 5.5 x 3-cm in diameter, involving the left fallopian tube and the surface of the left ovary with no angiolymphatic invasion.  It also revealed invasive adenocarcinoma, 3 (of 4), poorly-differentiated, forming 1.3- x 1.1- x 0.4-cm mass in the rectum invading into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic and vascular invasion was absent, and all surgical resection margins were negative.  Multiple (23) regional lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  The tumor was T2, N0.  Multiple lymph nodes were removed from the pelvis and the para-aortic area and were all negative for metastasis.
7.  October 1, 2010:  Ileostomy closure and anal dilatation was performed.
Since her most recent surgery, Mrs. Simmons is doing well with increasing appetite and energy level.  Her bowels are starting to stabilize and become more normal for her.  She has no other complaints.
