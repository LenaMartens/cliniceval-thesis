Final Diagnosis
A.	Colon, transverse, colectomy:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 3 (of 4), forming a 6.6 x 3.8 x 2.7 cm mass.  Tumor penetrates the visceral serosa.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor by at least 14 cm.  Multiple (15 of 22) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma AJCC pT4N2MX).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
