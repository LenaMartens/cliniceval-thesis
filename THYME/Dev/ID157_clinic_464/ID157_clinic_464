Mrs. Evan is a 56-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of rectal cancer.  I saw her in initial consultation on May 4, 2010.  In brief, she had a low-lying rectal polyp that was removed on colonoscopy with colonoscopic polypectomy on February 9, 2010.  Pathology showed tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia in which there was invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma that was extending to the deep biopsy margin.  There was some question thereafter with postpolypectomy rectal ultrasound whether or not there was a T2 versus a T3 lesion and potentially enlarged peritumoral nodes.  However, repeat transrectal ultrasound here at Kingsboro Psychiatric on April 29, 2010, did not substantiate any enlarged lymph nodes.  The patient declined APR and was taken to transanal excision on May 5, 2010, by Dr. Torres.  Pathology from surgical specimen showed biopsy site changes only with no residual adenocarcinoma or dysplasia identified.  Dr. Torres took wide margins, and I received a message from her that she and Mr. Basile in GI are not recommending any further radiotherapy.  I discussed this matter further with my supervisor, Dr. Clinger.  Given the fact that it is certainly possible that all of the tumor itself was within the polyp and not in the submucosal or muscularis layer, it is unclear as to whether or not the patient had a T1 versus a T2 lesion.  Close observation every three-months consisting of transrectal ultrasound, digital rectal exam, and potentially laboratories would be a reasonable approach.
I called the patient to inform her of this given the fact that I had recommended otherwise preoperatively. She had not yet been informed of the results of her pathology.  I explained this to her. She was quite pleased. She was also satisfied with my explanation of our revised recommendations following the surgical resection.  She has my card and will contact me in the future with further questions. Follow-up will be either as per her local physicians or with Mr. Basile in the GI Clinic.
