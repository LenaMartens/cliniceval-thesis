Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ill-defined mass (1.6 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm) located in the cecum, 10.0 cm from the proximal margin.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (36) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration of the tip with no evidence of tumor.  Multiple (2) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (0.4 cm and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) are identified in the ascending colon.  [AJCC ypT2N0M1].

B.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:  Mild chronic cholecystitis.

C.  Liver, segment II, excision:  Marked treatment effect with no definitive evidence of viable tumor.

D.  Liver, segment V and IVB, excision:  Residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in a fibrotic background with treatment effect.

E.  Liver, segment V, excision:  Residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in a fibrotic background with treatment effect.

F.  Liver, segment VII, excision:  Residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in a fibrotic background with treatment effect.

G.  Liver, segment VII #2, excision:  Residual grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in a fibrotic background with treatment effect (seen on frozen section slide), see comment.

H.  Liver, segment VIII, excision:  Marked treatment effect with no definitive evidence of viable tumor.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Pilar Brainard.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.



Diagnosis Comment
Non-neoplastic liver parenchyma with marked macrovesicular steatosis and moderate steatohepatitis.  No Mallory's hyaline is seen.  Bile ducts are well preserved.  Significant portal inflammation is not present.  Trichrome stain shows mild portal and sinusoidal/pericellular fibrosis.  Reticulin stain shows normal liver cell plates.  Iron stain is negative for hemosiderosis.  PAS-D stain is negative for hepatocyte intracytoplasmic inclusions.  The findings are consistent with toxic/metabolic liver injury.  Correlation with clinical and laboratory findings is needed.  The metastatic residual carcinoma is noted on the frozen section slides on part G.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 9.5 cm of terminal ileum, 19.5 cm of colon, and a 12.5 x 0.5 cm appendix.  A 0.5 x 0.5 cm fibrotic area is present within the cecum, 0.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The mass is 10.0 cm from the proximal (nearest) mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Multiple (2) polyps are present (0.4 cm and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) in the ascending colon.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PHIFER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""gallbladder"" is an 8.2 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 cm maximum wall thickness and patent cystic duct.  A cystic duct lymph node is not identified.  No stones are present within the lumen.  No masses are identified.  Mild cholesterolosis is present.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment II"" is a 1.3 gram, 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm nodule is present 0.2 cm from the surgical margin.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PHIFER.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment portion of V and IVB"" is a 39.9 gram, 7.0 x 4.7 x 3.8 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  There are multiple (2) masses (0.3 cm and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension) which are less than 0.1 cm from the closest resection margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PHIFER.

E. Received fresh labeled ""liver segment V"" is a 6.36 gram, 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm mass is present 0.1 cm from the surgical margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment VII"" is a 10.02 gram, 3.8 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm mass is present 0.4 cm from the surgical margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by WEBSTER.

G.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment VII #2"" is a 15.0 gram, 4.7 x 3.8 x 2.8 cm liver wedge specimen.  A single 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm mass is present 0.4 cm from the liver surgical margin. The background liver is tan-yellow.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PHILLIPS.

H.  Received fresh labeled ""liver segment VIII"" is a 16.0 gram, 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.2 cm partial hepatectomy specimen.  A single 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm mass is present 0.5 cm from the surgical margin. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PHIFER.
