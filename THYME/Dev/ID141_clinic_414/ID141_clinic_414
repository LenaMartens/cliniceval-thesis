#1 Metastatic colorectal carcinoma causing left ureteral obstruction
Her left kidney is basically not working.  The mass around the left ureter appears to be resectable to me.  I have spoken to Dr. Robin Ohara who reviewed the films, and he feels that if surgery is considered, he would favor intra-op radiation therapy.  As she had radiation therapy as late as November 2009, he would not give additional radiation therapy other than the intra-op radiation.  I spoke to Dr. Esparza and conveyed this message also so that when Dr. Sadie Robles sees the patient, she will have this information.  At this point, I would not advocate neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but, if this can be resected, intra-op radiation therapy given.  I feel certain she should get postop chemotherapy though, and this can be discussed following her surgery, depending on the findings.

PERTINENT ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
1.  2001:  Left breast lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy.  She received no postop chemotherapy.  She was given tamoxifen for five years and then Femara.
2.  July 23, 2007, right hemicolectomy for T4, N1, colon carcinoma.  The carcinoma invaded into the small-bowel; 2 of 26 nodes positive for metastatic disease.
3. Approximately August 2007-December 2007:  "19-20 sessions" of adjuvant therapy.  She originally was given FOLFOX but after two cycles of oxaliplatin, she developed a reaction, and, in addition, she has MS and could not tolerate it.  She continued treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin given twice a week.
4.  September 24, 2009:  CT-scan showed a cystic mass in the left adnexa.  This was biopsied through the bladder and was positive for metastatic disease.  October 1, 2009-November 10, 2009, she received radiation therapy of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions.  She did not receive any chemotherapy along with this.
5.  January 27, 2010, cystoscopic exam was positive for metastatic disease invading the bladder.  This was consistent with colorectal primary.  We have reviewed these slides and agree with the diagnosis.  She had a left ureteral stent placed as there was obstruction in the left ureter.  Surgery was recommended at Village Senior Residence Hospital (CC), and she sought a second opinion at Parkview Clinic in Lew Beach, and again surgery was recommended.  She was told that she might need a colostomy as well as a urostomy, and she therefore came to Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.  She was seen by Dr. Billy Jordan Esparza in Urology.
Overall, she feels well.  She has no pain.  She has noted no lumps or bumps.
