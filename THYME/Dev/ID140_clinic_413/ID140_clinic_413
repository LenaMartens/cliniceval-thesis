#1 Recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma, KRAS wild type
#2 Followup
Prior to meeting with Mrs. Caleb Johnson, I have had the opportunity to review her past medical records and laboratory tests.  Mrs. Caleb Johnson informed me that Dr. Cleary had informed her that she has approximately 10% of her viable tumor remaining from his most recent surgical procedure.  I informed her that due to this fact one could consider systemic chemotherapy.  I informed her that typically therapy does not start for approximately one-month after a surgical procedure.  Did visit that there is no right or wrong answer as to when to initiate therapy and therefore recommend that she return in approximately two-weeks' time to be evaluated for consideration of further therapy.  At this time I had a discussion regarding if she would be returning home or staying in the Denver.  Unclear.  She is leaning toward remaining in the Denver for initiation, at least, of the therapy and then transferring her care back home.  I did reassure her that therapy would be outlined for her provider at-home once we have had time to formally evaluate her, and that would be in approximately two-weeks' time.  Will have her return at that time.  In the interim I was able to speak with her primary oncologist, Dr. Ball, who is in agreement with this plan.  Will have the patient return in approximately two-weeks' time with repeat lab tests.  She denies any further questions or concerns.  Has our telephone number to contact us should she have any further questions or concerns.

Mrs. Caleb Johnson is a pleasant 50-year-old woman from Donnybrook.  I am seeing her today following her hospital dismissal for her history of recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma.  For comprehensive past medical history, please refer to my note dated August 27, 2010.  Briefly, her history is as follows:
1.  May 13, 2008:  Hospitalized for rectal bleeding and severe acute abdominal pain, ultrasound and biopsies noting intra-abdominal pus, endoscopy noting a fungating mass at the rectosigmoid area.
2.  June 15, 2008:  Low-anterior resection, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resection of the dome of the bladder, and temporary colostomy.  Pathology of the colon tissue was positive for adenocarcinoma, grade 2 (of 3), that infiltrated the serosa with pericolonic invasion to the bladder, uterus, and anterior abdominal wall.  Four (of 15) regional lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
3.  November 15, 2008:  Completed six-months of adjuvant chemotherapy, oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
4.  January 31, 2009, through March 9, 2009:  Radiation therapy performed, receiving a total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.
5.  January 12, 2010:  Imaging studies to this time were negative for disease recurrence.  Was taken the operating room for reversal of her colostomy and at this time noted a thickened area of fibrosis in the pelvis, biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.  Surgery was aborted at that point.  Postoperative course complicated with DVT and pulmonary embolism, presently on anticoagulation therapy.
6.  April 27, 2010:  Evaluated by Dr. Cleary of the Colorectal Surgery Department at KMC, who is stating potential surgical resection once additional chemotherapy is administered.
7.  May 25, 2010, through August 16, 2010:  Completed six cycles of FOLFIRI plus Erbitux therapy.
8.  September 22, 2010:  Dr. Cleary performed abdominal exploration with tumor debulking and an R1 resection of terminal ileum and portion of the ascending colon with ileoascending colostomy.  Pathology from a necrotic tumor excision of the pelvic rim is positive for moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with patchy necrosis.  Remaining tissue from the ileum and partial ascending colon positive for multifocal serosal involvement by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Of five regional lymph nodes removed, all were negative for metastatic disease.
Today Mrs. Caleb Johnson states that since her hospital dismissal she is continuing to feel better.  Reports that her appetite has been very good.  Weight has been relatively stable, if not increased slightly from her hospital dismissal weight.  She does continue to experience pain in the right lower abdomen that she is presently taking oxycodone and Advil for.  States that this pain is improving and that she is finding her activity level is increasing.  She denies any difficulties with her ostomy, stating that she is having a good output.  She denies any blood or mucus in the stool.  She has no specific complaints.
