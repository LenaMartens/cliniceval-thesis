Final Diagnosis
A.  Distal left colon, rectum, and prostate, resection:  Poorly differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerated mass (5.5 x 5.0 x 1.3 cm) located in the rectum.  The tumor invades through the rectal wall and directly invades the surrounding fibroadipose tissue and adjacent prostate.  All surgical resection margins; including the mucosal, prostate, and soft tissue margins; are negative for tumor.  The prostate shows treatment effect consistent with history of radiation.  Multiple (10 of 23) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Posterior bladder and seminal vesicle, re-excision:  Involved by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the soft tissue and prostatic tissue.  The seminal vesicle is uninvolved.  Extensive lymphovascular invasion is identified.

C.  Soft tissue, left periprostatic region, biopsy:  Fibroadipose tissue, no prostatic tissue identified, negative for tumor.

D.  Soft tissue, left anterior anus margin, biopsy:  Fibroadipose tissue, no prostatic tissue identified, negative for tumor.

E.  Soft tissue, right periprostatic region, biopsy:  Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, no prostatic tissue identified, negative for tumor.

F.  Rectum, right lateral pelvic wall margin, biopsy:  Fibroadipose tissue, negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N2] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""rectum"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 27.0 cm in length portion of rectum with a 14.2 x 2.5 cm portion of anus.  A 5.5 x 5.0 x 1.3 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 0.5 cm from the dentate line, present at the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  There is a 3.0 x 2.7 x 0.5 cm portion of adherent prostate with multiple indwelling radioactive seeds which are not hot by Geiger counter testing.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MYERS.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of seminal vesicle, back of bladder, check for cancer"" is a 5.1 x 4.8 x 1.5 cm fragment of soft tissue.  The surface adjacent to the main specimen is inked red, while the surface away from the main specimen is inked black.  Within the prostate tissue, multiple (8) radioactive seeds are identified which are not hot by Geiger02041094
 counter testing.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by YOUNG.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""left periprostatic margin"" is a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm fragment of red-tan soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by YOUNG.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""left anterior margin anus"" is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm fragment of red-tan soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by YOUNG.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""right periprostatic margins"" is a 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm fragment of red-tan soft tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by YOUNG.

F.  Received fresh labeled ""right lateral pelvic wall margin"" is a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm portion of tan-red fibrous tissue without orientation.  All submitted.  Grossed by MYERS.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Dr. Billy Rodriquez, k-ras mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded rectal tissue (block A2).  Upon completion, results will be available in OKBU QfreIydn.
