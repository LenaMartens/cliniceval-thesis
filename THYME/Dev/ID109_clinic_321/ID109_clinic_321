#1 Resected stage III cecal adenocarcinoma (T3, N1 [2 of 15], M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Watson service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Pryor, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
Mrs. Levy has decided to return in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation, but will pursue any treatment at-home in Garnerville.  I will make followup arrangements for her to include CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray, comprehensive laboratory panel including a CEA, and an evaluation by us in Medical Oncology in approximately three weeks per Dr. Pryor.  The patient verbalized understanding and is agreeable to the plan.

I was asked by Dr. Iglesias's service to visit with Mrs. Levy for postoperative education purposes.  She speaks Russian only, and the following consultation was done with the help of a BAC Virginia Beach interpreter.
1.  February 8, 2010 - self-referred to the Magma Clinic due to complaints of bilateral lower-extremity pain, lumbar discomfort, and buttock pain.  Diagnosed with spinal stenosis and a compression fracture.  During evaluation, she was noted to be anemic.
2.  February 9, 2010 - CT-scan of the abdomen was negative for distant metastasis.
3.  February 12, 2010 - underwent colonoscopy to the cecum which identified an ulcerated cecal mass.
4.  February 15, 2010 - taken for a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy by Dr. Iglesias.  Surgical pathology from the right hemicolectomy noted a grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma in the cecum forming a 4.9-cm x 3.4-cm x 0.6-cm mass.  The surgical margins were negative, and 2 of 15 regional lymph nodes was positive for adenocarcinoma.  This was staged at a T3, N1, M0.
Mrs. Levy is continuing to recover from surgery and was ambulating during our consultation today.
