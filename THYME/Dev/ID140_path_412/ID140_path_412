Final Diagnosis
A. Serosa, small bowel implant, biopsy:  Granulation tissue with marked acute and chronic inflammation.  Negative for tumor.

B.  Serosa, small bowel implant #2, biopsy:  Granulation tissue with marked acute and chronic inflammation. Negative for malignancy.

C.  Peritoneum, pelvic rim, necrotic tumor, excision:  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with patchy necrosis.

D.  Ileum, terminal and partial ascending colon, resection:  Multi-focal serosal involvement by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The mucosa of the ileum, appendix, and colon are unremarkable.  Multiple (5) regional lymph nodes are identified and are negative for malignancy.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel implant"" is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm fragment of pink tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by DAY.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""small bowel implant #2"" is a 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm aggregate of pink-tan tissue.  All submitted.  Grossed by BOLDUC.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""? necrotic tumor"" is a 7.2 x 5.3 x 1.2 cm aggregate of pink hemorrhagic tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DAY.

D.  Received fresh labeled terminal ileum and partial ascending colon is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 9.3 cm of terminal ileum, 8.3 cm of colon, and a 2.5 x 0.3 cm appendix. No mucosal lesions are identified. Also received are multiple irregular red tissue fragments measuring in aggregate, 5.5 x 4.3 x 1.2 cm. An anastomosis is present in the terminal ileum.  In the serosal surface of the ileum, multiple red firm adhesions are present, measuring up to 2.7 x 1.2 cm.  The appendix is grossly unremarkable.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat. Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DAY.
