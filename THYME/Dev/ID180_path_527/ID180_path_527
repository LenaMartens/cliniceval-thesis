Final Diagnosis
A.  Terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon; right hemicolectomy:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated mass (8.2 x 5.4 x 4.7 cm) in the cecum, 1.4 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic fat.  The appendix is without diagnostic abnormality.  All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  A single (1 of 17) regional lymph node is involveed by metastatic carcinoma.  (see comment)

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2010).





Diagnosis Comment
Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the cecal tumor using antibodies directed against the following antigens: keratin, CK7, CK20, chromogranin (x2), synaptophysin (x2), and CDX2.  The tumor cells are positive for keratin and CDX2 with weak, focal staining for CK 20.  There is also focal staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin.  They are negative for CK7.  A mucicarmine stain is positive.  The results support the above diagnosis.

Immunoperoxidase studies were also performed on the cecal tumor for mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2.  There is loss of MLH1 with secondary absence of PMS2.  MSH2 and MSH6 are intact.  Internal controls appropriately stained.  The results are diagnostic of a defect in mismatch repair protein MLH1 with secondary loss of PMS2.  Somatic versus germline mutation requires additional workup.  Clinical correlation recommended.

The tumor is poorly differentiated with only abortive gland formation.  The nested pattern of growth suggested neuroendocrine differentiation.  However, no significant chromogranin or synaptophysin staining is present.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 8.3 cm of terminal ileum, 17.0 cm of colon, and a 7.0 x 0.5 cm appendix.  An 8.2 x 5.4 x 4.7 cm ulcerative mass is present within the cecum, 1.4 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Grossly, the mass extends to the pericolonic fat.  The mass is 9.0 cm from the proximal mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by TAPP.
