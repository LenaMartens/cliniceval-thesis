IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Biopsy-proven recurrent rectal cancer from the vagina
Ms. Kent is referred for further evaluation and treatment of recurrent rectal cancer.  This is biopsy-proven from the vagina and likely involves her rectal stump.  Discussed with her the need for restaging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis and will obtain chest x-ray, lab work and ECG for purposes of anesthesia.  Patient will then meet with Dr. Elvira Wegman from colon and rectal surgery for surgical recommendations, followed with Dr. Jean Knox for consideration of intraoperative radiation therapy.  She has had complications from her previous radiation therapy of an enterocutaneous fistula which has subsequently resolved, a persistent rectovaginal fistula and a persistent abscess.  Patient will likely need to meet with stoma therapy at some point as well.  I provided her with prescriptions for Lyrica and MS-Contin along with renewal of her oxycodone for immediately release for pain control.  Examination under anesthesia may be most appropriate in assessing this woman's disease.
Discussed with Dr. Blanca Schaffer, note to follow.

Ms. Kent is a 62-year-old woman who presents for evaluation and treatment of recurrent rectal cancer.  Ms. Kent developed bronchitis in 2008 complicated by profound fatigue for which she sought care at an herbalist.  Lab studies performed demonstrated anemia at 4.0, and she reported to her hospital as advised where she was transfused.  EGD and colonoscopy August 27, 2008, was positive for a rectal mass, and she underwent surgical low-anterior resection September 24, 2008, for a T3 N1 mucinous adenocarcinoma involving 3 of 15 lymph nodes.  The tumor was 5-cm in size, and margins were clear by 2-cm.
Unfortunately, her postoperative course was complicated by anastomotic leak and peritonitis.  Her white count was elevated, but she was not febrile at the time.  She then underwent surgical exploratory laparotomy with drainage of intra-abdominal abscess, take-down of coloanal anastomosis and oversewing of rectal stump and colostomy.  Approximately 7- to 8-cm of rectal stump was left intact.
Ms. Kent then received postoperative chemoradiation.  She received 5040 centigray of radiation and 28 fractions from December 26, 2008, to January 20, 2009.  She then received FOLFOX which was completed June 2, 2009.  Her chemotherapy was complicated by angina from the 5-FU which was treated with nitroglycerine, and her cardiac evaluation was negative.  She continues to suffer from significant neuropathy which such cold feet that she is unable to fall asleep at night.  This has exacerbated her restless legs syndrome.
A surveillance CT abdomen and pelvis June 2009 was positive for 2.4- x 1.5- x 1.9-cm fluid collection.  In September 2009, she developed discharge from the rectum and vagina and was found to have a rectovaginal fistulae.  A surveillance CT December 17, 2009, was positive for growth of the fluid collection from 3.3- x 3.0- x 3.3-cm.
Ms. Kent underwent colonoscopy July 6, 2009, through the stoma and of the rectal stump.  Prep was reasonable, and the colonoscopy portion was negative.  The Hartmann likewise was negative for evidence of recurrent disease.  She is noted to have a chronic sinus tract of her abdominal wall in these reports.  This has apparently healed since then.  She underwent surgical parastomal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair, take-down of adhesions and excision of parastomal ulcer and revision of colostomy August 3, 2009.  Unfortunately, any attempt to take-down the colostomy was hampered by loops of small-bowel stuck to the anterior abdominal wall.
Ms. Kent underwent attempt at speculum exam in January 2010 which was hampered by vaginal stenosis from radiation therapy.  A biopsy obtained was positive for adenocarcinoma, consistent with colorectal primary and confirmed by LCC.  A restaging PET scan February 10, 2010, was positive for uptake in the pelvis but no evidence of distant metastases.  She presents now for resection and consideration of intraoperative therapy.  Her CEA was 3.2 preoperatively, and most recently in December 2009 was 1.5.
Current symptoms include significant abdominal pain, 9/10 on the pain scale, for which she uses oxycodone two tablets every four hours (usually three times daily).  She also has right lower quadrant pain that just developed over the past week, and has now developed a new stomal ulcer.  She also has chills and sweats but does not have a fever.  She has no dysuria.  She has persistent rectum and vaginal drainage.
Ms. Kent is otherwise healthy with chronic morbidities of restless legs syndrome and migraine headache.  Her GERD has not been problematic for her recently.  She denies any chest pain, pressure, discomfort or shortness-of-breath.  Fatigue and blurry vision have been problems for her.
There is no history of bleeding disorder, anesthesia reaction, thrombosis, heart attack, stroke, diabetes or nicotine dependence or sleep apnea.
