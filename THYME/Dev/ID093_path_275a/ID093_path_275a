Final Diagnosis
A.  Urinary bladder, right ureter margin, biopsy:  Ureteral tissue, negative for tumor.

B.  Urinary bladder, left ureter margin, biopsy:  Ureteral tissue, negative for tumor.

C.  Rectum and urinary bladder, resection:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (6.0 x 4.2 x 1.2 cm) located in the rectum.  The tumor invades into the muscularis propria of rectum.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  The urinary bladder is negative for tumor.  Multiple (15) perirectal regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. [AJCC pT2N0MX]

D.  Rectum, additional rectal margin, biopsy:  Anal mucosa with inflammation, negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
