[start section id="20112"]

#1 Sigmoid adenocarcinoma, grade 3, status-post low-anterior resection (T1, N1)
#2 Postoperative fluid collection measuring 67 x 37 mm in dimension left of the anastomosis
Per radiologist, this appears to be resolving seroma or hematoma.
#3 Anemia, resolving
#4 Hypertension
#5 Dyslipidemia
PLAN
I have discussed at length with Ms. Alford the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in her stage III adenocarcinoma of sigmoid.  We would recommend FOLFOX6 therapy for a total of 12 cycles.  The cycles are given two-weeks apart.  I have discussed the side-effects including, but not limited to, myelosuppression, life-threatening infection including death, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cardiac toxicity of 5-FU, hand/foot syndrome, stomatitis, neuropathy related to oxaliplatin (both acute and cumulative neurotoxicity), and nephrotoxicity.  I have suggested that she take her antihypertensive medications regularly since she missed her dose today.  She does have some postoperative fluid collection noted on her CT-scan of the abdomen today.  We will recheck a CT-scan in about three-months' time.  We do not believe this would be a contraindication to chemotherapy.  This has been discussed with Dr. Trujillo.  She indicated that she would get her chemotherapy closer to home and would notify us of her oncologist as soon as she finds one.  Meanwhile, she will contact Dr. Rivera's Service if she has any wound-related issues. Ordered k-ras mutation test. Results are  pending currently.

Treatment recommendations following resection of a node-positive sigmoid adenocarcinoma.

Ms. Alford is a very pleasant 69-year-old lady from Rhoadesville, Acworth who is accompanied today by her 20856 cousin.  She is here to discuss about the treatment recommendations following resection of a T1, N1 sigmoid grade 3 adenocarcinoma.  Ms. Alford' oncologic history is outlined below:
April 16, 2010, on a routine colonoscopy examination she was found to have 50% to 60% circumferential, flat, nodular area at 18 to 20 cm that was friable and would bleed at touch.  This was biopsied and found to be tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  It was not amenable to endoscopic removal.There was another 3-mm polyp in the ascending colon that was tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.  In addition, she had multiple sigmoid diverticulosis.
May 4, 2010, a proctoscopy was performed noting a polypoid lesion at 15 to 16 cm.  It was again not amenable to endoscopic removal, and on May 26 she underwent laparoscopic low-anterior resection.
Per operative report, exploration of the abdomen found no abnormalities, and the pathology of the rectosigmoid tissue was positive for moderately differentiated grade 3 adenocarcinoma.  Tumor was noted to arise in the tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  The surgical margins were negative.  Tumor invaded into the submucosa (T1).  All resected margins were negative, and of 15 regional lymph nodes, only 1 was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (pT1, N1).
Today, she is nearly slightly over four weeks out from her surgery and is here regarding adjuvant therapy.  Notably, she has been evaluated by our radiation oncology colleagues and has not been found to be a candidate for radiation therapy since it is a sigmoid adenocarcinoma primarily.  She states that her last colonoscopy was about two decades ago.  Over the last few months she had noticed some loose bowel movements with certain kinds of food along with some bloating sensation with spicy food.  Unfortunately, her sister recently passed away from ovarian cancer.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, loss of appetite, early satiety, palpitations, fever, or chills.  She did notice some discharge at the site of incision and was seen by Dr. Rivera today.  Apparently, there was an area of fluid collection (seroma) from which fluid has been expressed today by Dr. Rivera, and it is packed.  There is also some redness at the site of incision that she noticed in the last few weeks.

1.  History of large cystocele noted on cystoscopy that was performed for microscopic hematuria in April 2010.  Urine cytology was negative, and cystoscopy did not demonstrate any evidence of cancer or suspicious lesions.  She was, therefore, asked to repeat a urine cytology and urinalysis in six-months.
2.  Bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy for "benign" lesions in 1980s.
3.  Bladder prolapse requiring surgery about five years after her hysterectomy.
4.  Sciatica, left leg.  No neurological deficits.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Dyslipidemia.
