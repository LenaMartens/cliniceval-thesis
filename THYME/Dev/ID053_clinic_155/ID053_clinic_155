#1 Metastatic rectal carcinoma to nodes with FAP
PLAN
1.  I will see him again following his PET scan.
2.  I discussed treatment with chemotherapy with goals and side-effects.  I discussed the regimen of FOLFOX plus Avastin as first-line treatment.  He wants to get started on treatment and wishes it in 33919.  I called Dr. Terry Kernan to help set-up an appointment.  They will also set-up for a new baseline CT-scan to see response to treatment.  In addition, they will set him up for a Port-A-Cath.  I discussed the toxicities of FOLFOX plus Avastin.  I will see him again in two days following his PET scan.  We will not set-up a routine appointment for him but told him I would be happy to see him at any time, but he should be seen at some point when a decision would need to be made about possible change in treatment.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Metastatic rectal carcinoma.

Mr. Joyner is 31 years old.  Pertinent oncologic history:
1.  Intermittent rectal bleeding for six-months but more so in spring 2010.
2.  He developed back pain, which prompted him to seek medical evaluation.  His stool has changed with an increase in frequency and decrease in caliber.
3.  March 29, 2010:  Colonoscopy positive for numerous polyps throughout the colon as well as circumferential mass at 15-cm.  The biopsy was moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
4.  Patient came to the Wise Sanitarium Number 1 Memorial Hospital and was seen in Gastroenterology April 7, 2010.  Repeat colonoscopy with EUS confirmed a nonobstructing rectal carcinoma, and in addition, there were numerous retroperitoneal nodes as high as 50 cm seen between the sigmoid colon and the aortic bifurcation at 25 cm.  On biopsy, these were positive for malignancy.  He underwent upper endoscopy also and had multiple polyps in his stomach.
5.  He was seen by Dr. Dale Miller of Colorectal Surgery, who did not feel he was a surgical candidate at this time.  He was then seen by Dr. Jessie Boles, who felt the extent of the nodal disease was too much for radiation at this time.
He is referred to West Tennessee Tuberculosis Hospital.  He does have discomfort in his back, and he has occasional rectal bleeding.  He otherwise is active and feels well.
