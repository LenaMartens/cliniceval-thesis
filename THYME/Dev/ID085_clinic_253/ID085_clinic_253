IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN
#1 Colon adenocarcinoma with evidence of nodal and hepatic metastatic disease
Mrs. Register has colon cancer with nodal involvement as well as multiple areas of hepatic involvement.  She has undergone what sounds like a gross total resection at this time, although the surgical note is not yet posted.
I discussed the nature of stage IV colon cancer with Mrs. Register and her husband today.  We discussed the fact that even in the setting of a gross total resection, there are likely areas of micrometastatic disease at this point and thus her risk of recurrence is very high.  Given this, we would recommend that she undergo postoperative chemotherapy and we would recommend 12 cycles of FOLFOX in this setting.  Given the fact that this postoperative treatment could truly be considered for metastatic disease as opposed to in the adjuvant setting, bevacizumab could be considered as well.
These recommendations were discussed in general terms with Mrs. Register and her husband.  Also discussed was the generally poor prognosis of patient's with stage IV colon cancer, as well as the fact that with resection of metastatic disease as well as postoperative chemotherapy, there can be an improvement in recurrence and long-term survival rates.
Given the fact that Mrs. Register's previous colonoscopy did not encompass the entire colon, we would also recommend that she undergo another colonoscopy within six-months in an effort to ensure there are no other lesions of concern.
#2 Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma
Mrs. Register has what appears to be a low-grade sarcoma which is confined to the uterus at this time without evidence of local invasion or nodal spread.  For this reason, I think observation is a reasonable course of action at this time.  Should she develop evidence of distant disease, progesterones would be reasonable, and we would recommend the avoidance of estrogen therapy in this setting.
Mrs. Register plans to receive her care at the BAMH Connecticut in Brandamore.  We will forward all our records to that center, and we will plan on her receiving her care there.  For that reason we will not be setting up any follow-up with medical oncology at this time, although we reenforced that should she have questions, concerns, or want a further opinion, we would be happy to see her back at any time in the Golden State Palms Convalescent of Ottumwa Center.
Thank-you very much for involving us in Mrs. Register's care.  Please feel free to contact us with questions or concerns via the Medical Oncology Consult pager (563-915-23693).
ADDENDUM:  Final path report confirms preliminary.  Colon cancer staged as pT3N2aM1a with 5/14 nodes positive.  Uterine specimen reveals low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma forming a 5.2 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm polypoid mass in the endometrial cavity with focal invasion into the underlying myometrium.  The margins of resection are negative for malignancy. 47 sampled lymph nodes negative (jsb 9/10/10 1545)

Mrs. Register is a very pleasant 58-year-old female from Eau Claire who has had intermittent rectal bleeding for five years.  She states that this was typically blood-streaked stools, and for this she underwent a colonoscopy in June of 2005 which revealed two hyperplastic polyps which were removed.  Subsequently in follow-up she had another colonoscopy in February of 2009 which was per report unremarkable.
Mrs. Register reports that over the course of the past six-months this rectal bleeding got significantly worse to the point where in the late spring she was having five to six loose bowel movements a day with a significant blood content.  Also, over the last six-months she has lost approximately 40 pounds and been suffering from increasing nausea, mild abdominal pain and fatigue.
Given these symptoms, in May of 2010, upon returning from their winter stay in California, Mrs. Register presented to her primary-care provider, and an evaluation was undertaken.  A CT-scan was performed on June 8, 2010 which revealed a 2- x 2.3-cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver concerning for a metastatic deposit as well as an apparent enhancing mass in the endometrial canal with dilatation of the endometrial canal.  Per report, the initial read of this CT-scan did not reveal evidence of a sigmoid lesion, but our over read here at Milwaukee University of Iowa Family Care Center does suggest irregular thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon.
Given these findings, Mrs. Register subsequently underwent a colonoscopy on July 13, 2010 which reveled a 25-cm circumferential sigmoid mass.  Biopsy of this region revealed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  It should be noted that this colonoscopy only went to the transverse colon due to discomfort.  Further evaluation of these multiple abnormal findings in Florence included a pelvic ultrasound on July 27, 2010 revealing a 3.5-cm heterogenous solid lobulated mass throughout the central aspect of the uterus.  At this point, Mrs. Register transferred her care to RH in an effort to expedite the evaluation and potential treatment.
Mrs. Register presented to Milwaukee University of Iowa Family Care Center in early August of 2010 and was evaluated by Colorectal, Hepatic, and GYN Surgery.  As part of this evaluation, on August 3, 2010 an endometrial biopsy was performed which revealed a low-grade endometrial stromal neoplasm.  The result of this evaluation was a recommendation to proceed with a multidisciplinary surgical procedure including resection of the primary sigmoid lesion, any areas of obvious metastatic disease of the liver, as well as her uterus.
Mrs. Register underwent this combination surgery on September 2, 2010.  The operative note is not yet posted, but per the postprocedure note, an open sigmoidectomy, TAH/BSO, and resection of segments 3, 5, 6, and 8 of the liver, as well as bilateral pelvic and periaortic lymphadenopathy was performed.  The preliminary pathology reports from this procedure are consistent with an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with multiple areas of hepatic metastatic disease.  Five of 14 lymph nodes in the abdomen were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Per report, the uterine pathology is consistent with a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, without evidence of extrauterine spread and negative pelvic lymph nodes.  The final path results are still pending at this time.
Mrs. Register is now postop day No. 1.  She is in significant pain, although her PCA does help with the pain control.  She has not passed flatus or stool as of yet and also has some nausea.  She frankly denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, focal neurologic symptom, or urinary symptoms at this time.
