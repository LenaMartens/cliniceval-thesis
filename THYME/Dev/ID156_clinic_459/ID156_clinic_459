#1 Metastatic colorectal carcinoma
#2 Indeterminate lung lesion
#3 Indeterminate liver lesions, likely metastatic disease
#4 Obstipation
#5 Iron-deficiency anemia, secondary to colorectal adenocarcinoma
In review of the patient's relevant history, outside medical records, available laboratory studies, and radiology studies, the situation is consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and lungs.  We do not have biopsy of the liver or lung lesions at this time, although we are highly suspicious that these are metastatic lesions.  We will further explore the extent of his disease with a PET/CT-scan to see if these liver or lung lesions do show increased uptake.
Unfortunately the patient is significantly anemic at this time and does continue to bleed.  He also has obstipation due to his mass in the rectum.  We are unclear of the extent of narrowing of the rectum and have recommended that he undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy in order to determine whether or not he does have impending obstruction at this point.  If he does impending obstruction, perhaps he would be a candidate for rectal stent verus diverting colostomy.  The patient expresses interest in surgery of the primary rectal tumor at this point; however, we have counseled him that a surgery upfront would be less desirable as we are unlikely to be able to remove all of his cancer in that area with his significant lymphadenopathy surrounding the colorectal mass.  He will visit with the colorectal surgeons later this week in order for further treatment planning following his endoscopy procedure.
We did recommend to the patient that ideally we would start with chemotherapy to treat his disease systemically which will hopefully result in shrinkage of the mass in the rectal area, improvement in his bowel movements, and slowing of the bleeding which will then improve his anemia.  He likely needs Senokot therapy as well as iron replacement; however, I have not prescribed these at this time as I would like to see the results of the flexible sigmoidoscopy to prove that he does not have complete obstruction.  We would recommend FOLFOX chemotherapy upfront for a couple of months followed ideally by chemotherapy with radiation therapy to treat his local disease, followed by surgical resection.  The patient will visit with Radiation Oncology later in the week as well for further treatment planning.
I will plan to see him back following his tests and further consultations to come up with the final recommendations.
Dr. Johnson has met with the patient as well and is in agreement with the above plan.

Patient is a pleasant 49-year-old man, previously healthy, who presents with a recent diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.  His recent history is summarized below as follows:
1.  July 2009 patient has bright-red bleeding per rectum as well as pain with bowel movements.
2.  September 2009 patient presents to the emergency room with pain with bowel movements and rectal bleeding.  He is treated for hemorrhoids.
3.  March 2010 patient has continued bleeding, weakness and obstipation along with narrow stool caliber.  Hemoglobin at that time is 10.1 with MCV 78, platelets elevated at 516,000 and normal liver tests.
4.  April 5, 2010, colonoscopy showed poor preparation; however, a mass was noted in the proximal rectum extending 9-cm proximally.  Biopsy was consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Iron studies at that time show ferritin 5, serum iron 18, iron-binding capacity 382.
5.  April 8, 2010, patient meets with a surgeon who recommends LAR.
6.  April 9, 2010, further staging including a CT abdomen and pelvis shows pulmonary nodules within the lingula and left lower lobe as well as several low-attenuation liver lesions, the largest superiorly and posteriorly in the right hepatic lobe measures 3.6 x 2.5-cm, thickening in the rectosigmoid junction and rectal wall with several small perirectal nodules in the presacral space with question of enlarged lymph nodes or extra serosal tumor implants.  Comments also include mildly thickened bladder wall as well as lucency in the left ilium.  CEA at this time is 8.3.
Patient presents today with continued concerns of severe pain and difficulty passing bowel movements.  The patient finds after he eats that he feels distended and bloated.  He has started to eat less in order to avoid the painful bowel movements.  He does have bleeding consisting of bright-red blood with almost every bowel movement.  The bleeding is significant in amount, although he has difficulty quantifying that for me.  Overall he feels that his stools are soft, but he has a feeling of mechanical obstruction to passing the stool.  He has lost approximately 10 pounds in the last month.  He does have decreased energy due to his anemia and is sleeping more than usual.  He has avoided taking iron replacement therapy other than an herbal medicine containing iron as he would like to avoid the constipating side-effects of iron replacement therapy.
