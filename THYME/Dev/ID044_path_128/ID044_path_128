Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, transverse, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (3.8 x 3.5 x 0.7 cm) located in the transverse colon, 6.0 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.   Lymphatic/vascular invasion is present.  A 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm tumor nodule is present in the mesentery, separate from the mucosal tumor.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A separate sessile serrated adenoma (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm) is present 0.2 cm to the nearest margin. A single (of 16) regional lymph node is involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N1aMx].

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""portion transverse colon and mesenteric mass"" is a transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 20.0 cm of colon and 15.0 x 6.0 x 0.8 cm portion of omentum.  A 3.8 x 3.5 x 0.7 cm ulcerative mass is present within the transverse colon, 6.0 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  There is an additional 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm sessile polyp located 0.2 cm to the closest margin and a 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm mesenteric mass displaying a tan-white to yellow cut surface.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by LEBLANC.


Addendum Diagnosis
Scant necrotizing granulomas are seen in one of the regional lymph nodes.  Special stains for microorganisms (AFB and GMS) are negative.
