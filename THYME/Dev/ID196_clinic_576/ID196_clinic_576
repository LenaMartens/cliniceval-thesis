#1 Recurrent rectal cancer
Mr. Epstein is a 70-year-old male who had a low-anterior resection June 2009 for a T2, N0, M0 cancer of the rectum.  He received no chemotherapy and had previously had radiation to the prostate in 2007, so received no radiation either.  Colonoscopy in early July apparently showed an ulceration, and biopsies were indeterminate but read here were suspicious for cancer.  Colonoscopy report is not in the patient's outside records.  Exam under anesthesia, proctoscopic biopsy of anal mass on 20 July 2010, did show adenocarcinoma, invasive grade 3 of 4.  The patient apparently had a CT-scan which showed no metastasis, but again, report and CT is not in outside records.  CEA May 2010 was 2.0.  The patient now comes for definitive treatment of the above.
