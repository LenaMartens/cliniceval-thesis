His laboratory results reveal hemoglobin of 10.9, MCV of 69.1, platelet count 241 with leukocytes of 7.0.  INR 1.3.  Sodium 147, potassium 3.3, calcium 9.4, phosphorus 4.0, glucose 176.  Normal liver enzymes.  Creatinine 1.3.  BUN 26.
EKG reveals atrial fibrillation with heart rate of 82.  The patient has anteroseptal infarct and nonspecific T-wave abnormality.
Chest x-ray reveals calcified granuloma of the left lower lobe.  The patient has left pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.  The patient has associated parenchymal opacity at the left base that could represent rounded atelectasis.  The patient has moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

PLAN
I have discussed laboratory results with the patient as well as the chest x-ray and the EKG.  The patient has been asymptomatic.  He is on beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor.  The patient is off Coumadin due to his current anemia and the planned procedure to remove his colon cancer.  The patient is going to see his surgeon on Thursday.  There is no need for an invasive management at this time, as the patient needs surgery if indicated and it will not change the plan of care.  The patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors.  He has moderate surgical risk of perioperative cardiovascular morbidity/mortality of 5% to 10%.  The patient needs to continue on his beta-blocker during the preoperative period for a target heart rate of 60 beats per minute.  Volume overload will be risky during the perioperative time due to his history of congestive heart failure and he might need intravenous Lasix.  I advised the patient to contact his primary-care provider to increase the dose of potassium, especially if it is low, he might need to cut down slightly on the diuretic, because his sodium is getting at higher-level.

This is a 73-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease status-post MI 19 years ago, status-post CABG 2007 times two vessels.  The patient has history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, as well as prior history of chronic anticoagulation.  The patient has history of hypertension and insulin-dependent diabetes as well as hyperlipidemia.  The patient had shortness-of-breath two-months ago, and he was found to have microcytic anemic as well as splenic flexure colon cancer.  The patient also was found to have exacerbation of his CHF with increased swelling and increased weight.  They went up on his Lasix because of his exertional shortness-of-breath at that time.  He was not able to walk more than one block.  He had orthopnea.  The patient improved on increasing dose of Lasix as well as iron supplement.  The patient currently has no shortness-of-breath except with extreme exertion.  The patient denies orthopnea.  The patient does not use oxygen.  The patient denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient had chest pain at the time within the form of heaviness, but currently, he denies any chest pain.  The patient denies any palpitations.  The patient denies any leg swelling.  The patient lost weight, and he does not feel congested as before.  The patient has history of A-fib for two years on chronic anticoagulation; however, after the discovery of his anemia, they stopped Coumadin about four weeks ago.  His INR today is 1.3.  The patient denies any history of stroke.  The patient has had diabetes for 20 years.  He has been on insulin for one-year.  The patient has history of congestive heart failure.  His last echo was one-year ago in Jumping Branch.  He said that his EF was 37 however no actual report.  He had pleural effusions on-and-off.  The last one was aspirated through thoracentesis about last winter in Jumping Branch.  The patient never smoked.  He has family history of coronary artery disease but no premature atherosclerosis.  The patient does not drink alcohol.  The patient takes his medication on time.  There was no coronary angiogram done after his bypass surgery.  The patient is not aware of any stents done after his bypass surgery as well.
