Reviewed outside colonoscopy and pathology reports, CT report.  His film is on QREADS, and his slides have been read by Pathology.
#1 Metachronous colon cancer in the setting of left-sided colitis
Mr. Benefield presents to O'Connor Hospital of Brooklyn for treatment of colon cancer.  This is his second colorectal cancer as he is status-post low-anterior resection in 1999 for T3, N0, M0 rectal cancer.  He has left-sided colitis diagnosed two years ago, currently off any treatment.  He suffers from five to ten loose stools daily with associated fecal incontinence.  I shared with him that it maybe reasonable to consider a total colectomy or subtotal colectomy potentially with a stoma instead of a segmental resection.  As reviewed with Dr. Weaver, we will repeat a colonoscopy and obtain further biopsies to assess the extent of the colitis.  Liver ultrasound will also be checked, and his outside CT will be sent to Radiology for interpretation.  Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Patient will meet with Dr. Grassi from Colon and Rectal Surgery upon completion of his evaluation for surgical discussion.  He may need to meet with the stoma nurse if the surgeon recommends a stoma.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Lab work, chest x-ray, and ECG are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, the patient is okay for anesthesia.  I will obtain baseline amylase and lipase levels given his history of pancreatitis, although this currently appears stable.  Please see HPI for significant comorbidities of renal insufficiency, history of pancreatitis, and diabetes mellitus.
I discussed with Dr. Lindsay Weaver.  Note to follow.

Metachronous colon cancer in the setting of left colon colitis.

Mr. Benefield is an 81-year-old gentleman who is referred for treatment of sigmoid colon cancer.  He has a complicated medical history of pancreatitis, left-sided colitis, and rectal cancer as outlined below.  His most recent finding of sigmoid colon cancer was found on colonoscopy October 5, 2010, performed for hematochezia.  A two-thirds circumferential partially obstructing mass was found in the sigmoid colon measuring 5-cm in length.  Biopsies taken demonstrated moderately to poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The mass was not tattooed.  This is his second colon cancer.  His first cancer was a rectal cancer resected in 1999 with low-anterior resection for a T3, N0 malignancy.  He received postoperative chemoradiation closer to home which was well-tolerated.  Other colonoscopy findings included a diffuse area of moderately congested erythematous and area of decreased vascular pattern mucosa in the rectum, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid.  Again, biopsies were taken which demonstrate focal minimal crypt distortion but no evidence of acute, chronic, or microscopic colitis.  Uncas on Thames Medical Clinic Pathology has reviewed slides and confirms similar interpretation.  Biopsies were also obtained from the right colon which visually appeared normal, and pathology was also normal.
Mr. Benefield's colitis was diagnosed on colonoscopy locally December 12, 2008.  At that time diffuse area of severe congestion, erythema, and friability and phlegm mucosa was noted in the rectum and rectosigmoid.  Biopsies taken were positive for mild crypt architectural disarray consistent with inactive inflammatory bowel disease as well as one portion of colonic mucosa with mild patchy increase and lamina propria chronic inflammation.  A moderate amount of stool was noted in the colon at the time along with a diffuse area of mildly congested mucosa throughout the entire colon.  He was initially treated with prednisone and Rowasa enemas.  He now is currently off any IBD medicine.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis October 18, 2010, with oral contrast (no IV contrast due to renal insufficiency) showed constipation but no evidence for liver metastasis and no other worrisome incidental findings.
Comorbidities include a history of pancreatitis.  This is idiopathic.  He has had at least eight bouts, most recently two years ago when he was hospitalized for a month.  His pancreatitis had been evaluated here in March 1999.  He had a pancreatic pseudocyst which required stenting on two occasions.  The stent has since been removed.  He also has had a sphincterotomy as well as a surgical cystojejunostomy in January 1997.  A celiac axis was blocked on each side of the celiac artery.  He also had a fistulae noted on November 30, 2008, extending from the pancreatic pseudocyst in the body and tail of the pancreas to adjacent small-bowel.  There is no mention of a fistula on his CT-scan.  The patient's wife states that since he was placed on Prevacid he has had no problem.
Mr. Benefield's current bowel function is five to ten stools per day with fecal incontinence for which he uses a Depends pad.  He has intentionally lost 90 pounds over the past two years, more so over recent months.  He was intentionally losing weight due to his diagnosis of diabetes.  There is no nausea or vomiting or melena.  He has noted hematochezia, which prompted the colonoscopy.
Other comorbidities include stage 3 chronic renal insufficiency.  Recent nephrology evaluation notes suggest this is related to late-onset hypertension and atrophic left kidney and possible renal artery stenosis.  His creatinine October 14, 2010, was 1.9.  He also takes medicines for rosacea and allergic rhinitis.
Mr. Benefield denies a history of a heart attack, stroke, bleeding disorder, or anesthesia reaction.  He has no medication allergies.  He takes Creon for his pancreatitis and metoprolol and lisinopril for hypertension.   He also takes cholestyramine and Metamucil for diarrhea.
The current medications are per EOP.
