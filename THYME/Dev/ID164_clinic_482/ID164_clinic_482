#1 Resected synchronous colon adenocarcinoma of the terminal ileum and cecum with positive lymph nodes
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Bell service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Perez, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week postoperative recovery period.
Mrs. Myrick has decided not to return in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation.  Therefore, I have asked Dr. Perez to visit with Mrs. Myrick prior to dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  At this point, I am not making followup arrangements for her, but certainly if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to help facilitate care.

I was asked by Dr. Bell service to visit with Mrs. Myrick for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mrs. Myrick is a very pleasant 53-year-old female from the APO San Francisco, CA 96302 North Dakota, area.  She has a prior past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis since 1984, treated medically.
1.  May 2010 - presented to Berkley East Convalescent Center with an outside colonoscopy showing a stricture with dysplasia in the transverse colon.
2.  May 11, 2010 - CT enterography showed a 5.1-cm transverse colon mass as well as regional lymph nodes that were suspicious for regional metastatic disease.  There was no evidence of distant metastasis.  Chest x-ray was negative.  CEA was 2.6.
3.  May 13, 2010 - taken by Dr. Hammack for a subtotal colectomy.  Per the operative note, there was no evidence of distant metastasis.  Surgical pathology noted two separate masses.  One was located 5-cm from the terminal ileum and measured 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.5-cm in size.  The other was in the transverse colon and measured 6.0 x 5.2 x 1.2-cm in size.  Both invaded through the muscularis propria and involved 4 of 37 regional lymph nodes.
Mrs. Myrick is continuing to recover from surgery and was sitting up in bed during our consultation today.
