#1 Treatment recommendations following resection of a node-negative colon cancer (T3, N0)
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Crow through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mr. Stern is a pleasant 70-year-old gentleman from Kansas Martville.  I am seeing him today in follow-up following a resection of a T3, N0 right-sided colon adenocarcinoma.  Mr. Stern's history is as follows:
1.  May 3, 2010 - Presented to his primary-care provider, Dr. Terry Buchanan, for a multisystem evaluation.  Patient was concerned about prostate cancer.  He stated that he was experiencing abdominal pain daily that is worse with eating.
2.  May 7, 2010 - Underwent a routine colonoscopy which noted a mass lesion at the hepatic flexure which was friable.  Biopsies obtained from this were positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  There appeared to be a thickened area at 70 cm.  Proximal to this was an ulcer that was partially healed.  This area was biopsied and found to be normal.  He had also a rectal polyp removed which was hyperplastic.
3.  May 11, 2010 - CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted calcified granuloma in the right lower lung.  Tiny nodule in the right upper lung.  Circumferential mass in the hepatic flexure of the colon consistent with adenocarcinoma. Enlargement of his prostate.
4.  May 25, 2010 - Dr. Benedetti performed robotic assisted extended right hemicolectomy.  Per operative report, no metastatic disease was found.  Pathology from the extended right hemicolectomy was positive for invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon.  Tumor invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat.  Surgical resected margins are negative.  Of 57 regional lymph nodes removed, all negative for metastatic disease (pT3, N0).
Today Mr. Stern states that he continues to feel extremely well.  He states that if he did not have incision sites he would not know that he had surgery or had any abnormalities.  He reports that his bowels have returned to normal, having a daily bowel movement that is absent of blood and mucus.  He reports his appetite has been very good.  Weight has been stable.  Energy level has returned to normal.  He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, elevated temperature.
