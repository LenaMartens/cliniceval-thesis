Final Diagnosis
A.  Lymph node, peri-pancreatic, biopsy:  A single peri-pancreatic lymph node is negative for tumor.

B.  Lymph node, middle colic, biopsy:  A single middle colic lymph node is negative for tumor.

C.  Omentum, omentectomy:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Lymph nodes, apical middle colic, biopsy:  Multiple (2) apical middle colic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E.  Stomach, transverse colon, omentum, resection:  Moderately (grade 3 of 4) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, forming a 11.0 x 8.0 x 3.0 cm annular mass in the transverse colon.  Tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and directly invades other organs or structures (gastric serosa and omentum).  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (5 of 23) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N2a] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A. Received fresh labeled ""peri-pancreatic lymph node"" is a 2.5 x 2.1 x 0.4 cm cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  Lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by GUTIERREZ.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""middle colic node"" is a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  Lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by GUTIERREZ.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""omentum"" is a 12.0 x 8.0 x 0.5 cm portion of omentum.  No masses are identified grossly.  Lymph nodes are not identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by FRYE.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""apical middle colic node"" is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.  Lymph nodes submitted.  Grossed by FRYE.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""portion stomach, transverse colon, omentum"" is a transverse colectomy specimen consisting of 23.0 cm of colon and 15.0 x 12.0 x 4.0 cm portion of omentum.  A 11.0 x 8.0 x 3.0 cm mass is present within the transverse colon, 9.0 cm from the necrotic closest mucosal.  Grossly, the mass extends through the muscle and into the stomach and omentum. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DUPRE
