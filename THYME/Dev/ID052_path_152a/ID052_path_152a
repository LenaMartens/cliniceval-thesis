Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Microscopic focus of well differentiated grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified arising in a tubular adenoma (3.6 x 2.6 x 0.4 cm) with high grade dysplasia located in the cecum, 14.0 cm from the terminal ileum mucosal resection margin.  The tumor invades into the lamina propria where it generates a desmoplastic reaction, but does not invade into the submucosa.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (31) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. [AJCC pTis N0]

B.  Colon, additional ascending, resection:  Portion of large bowel without diagnostic abnormality.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Jamie C. Wheaton

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 12.5 cm of terminal ileum, 33.0 cm of colon, and no appendix.  A 3.6 x 2.6 x 0.4 cm polypoid mass is present within the cecum, 2.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.  Tumor perforation is absent.  The mass is 14.0 cm from the terminal ileum mucosal margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MANDEL

B.  Received fresh labeled ""additional ascending colon"" is a 7.0 cm in length portion of bowel with an anastomosis.  The mucosa is unremarkable.  Grossed by JACKSON.


Frozen Sect-Intraop
A.  Colon, right, hemicolectomy:  Tubular adenoma with high grade dysplasia (3.6 x 2.6 x 0.4 cm) and a focus of at least intramucosal adenocarcinoma in the cecum.  Hold over to rule out deeper invasion.

B.  Colon, additional ascending, resection:  Portion of large bowel without diagnostic abnormality.
