#1 Pneumonia, presumed healthcare associated
Mrs. Duran has had significant improvement since starting antibiotics.  For now, we will plan to continue with vancomycin dosed according to her random level, cefepime 2-g after dialysis only on dialysis days, and Cipro 400-mg IV every 24-hours, given after dialysis on dialysis days.  We will provide her with an incentive spirometer and an Acapella valve.  Blood cultures were drawn at dialysis and again in the Emergency Department, results are currently pending.  We will adjust antibiotic therapy based on culture results.  We will check a sputum specimen for Gram stain, culture, and susceptibilities.  We will wean her oxygen as tolerated.
#2 Fever and chills
This could be related to pneumonia, bacteremia, her pulmonary emboli, or the splenic infarct.  As above, we have started empiric antibiotic therapy for her presumed pneumonia.  We will monitor the results of her blood cultures and tailor antibiotic therapy appropriately.
#3 Pulmonary emboli with history of DVT
At this time, following discussion with Vascular Medicine, we do not feel that her pulmonary emboli are symptomatic.  Given that the source, her AV graft, shows only a small residual thrombus, and given concerns that she may be at increased risk for bleeding with full-dose anticoagulation, we will not provide treatment at this time.  However, if she continues to be hypoxemic and/or develops hemodynamic compromise, we may need to start empiric anticoagulation.  We will monitor closely in case the pulmonary emboli are indeed the cause of her symptoms rather than a possible infectious process.
#4 Splenic infarct
Given concern that the source could be a possible valvular thrombus or aortic thrombus or plaque, we are obtaining an emergent TEE tonight.  If this does show thrombus, we will start full-dose anticoagulation.  In this case, we feel that the benefits of anticoagulation would outweigh the risks.  While there is a theoretical risk of splenic hemorrhage, we also feel the benefit of anticoagulation would outweigh a possible complication in this regard.  Hopefully, we will not have to provide anticoagulation.  In the meantime, Mrs. Duran's pain has resolved, although we will have available as-needed Tylenol and low-dose oxycodone.
#5 Chronic kidney disease, on hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
I greatly appreciate the prompt evaluation of Dr. Jean Patton; I had the privilege of meeting with her in the Emergency Department this evening.  She provided recommendations which we will follow; at this time it does not appear that Mrs. Duran has evidence of volume overload requiring emergent dialysis.  We will have her on a diabetic and dialysis diet and provide her with a fluid restriction.  I will not replace her slightly low-potassium at this time but will recheck electrolytes in the morning.
#6 Diabetes mellitus
We will check glucose four times daily, provide her with a diabetic and dialysis diet, and continue her NPH insulin.  We will give her usual 4 units this evening but will give her a reduced dose of 20 units (her normal is 28 units) in the morning pending resumption of normal oral intake and depending on her glucose levels.  Her last hemoglobin A1C of May 17, 2010, was 6.7.
#7 History of diastolic heart failure
Mrs. Duran appears euvolemic, although she does have a significantly elevated NT-proBNP which is in the setting of her chronic hemodialysis.  We will closely monitor her fluid balance.
#8 Coronary artery disease based on positive dobutamine stress ECHO
Mrs. Duran did have an elevated troponin of 0.08.  This was stable, and her value was previously 0.07 times three on August 9, 2009.  I also reviewed her ECG.  At this time, I do not feel that she has had an acute coronary syndrome, but the elevated troponins are related to her chronic hemodialysis.  We will continue her aspirin, metoprolol, and Zocor.
#9 History of hypertension
We will continue Mrs. Duran's metoprolol.
#10 History of GERD
We will continue omeprazole.
#11 Gout
We will continue allopurinol.
#12 Depression
We will continue Lexapro.
#13 Macrocytic anemia
Mrs. Duran likely has anemia of chronic kidney disease, but she does have a macrocytosis which is longstanding.  I note that her B12, folate, and TSH from a year ago are unremarkable.  We will check a peripheral smear.  She will continue with outpatient treatment as indicated.
#14 Mild thrombocytopenia
This has been intermittent and chronic based on review of her previous labs.  I wonder if her quinine could be contributing.  Per my discussion with Pharmacy tonight, quinine is restricted only to patients with malaria so we will not provide this medication unless she develops significant leg cramps at the time of dialysis.
#15 Debility
Mrs. Duran typically can only stand briefly for transfers and is generally not ambulatory.  She uses a wheelchair for mobility.  We will have physical therapy work with her while she is hospitalized.
#16 Strict isolation
Mrs. Duran has history of VRE.
#17 DVT prophylaxis
We will provide Subcu heparin twice-daily for DVT prophylaxis unless Mrs. Duran is found to have evidence of valvular or aortic thrombosis, in which case we will provide full-dose anticoagulation with IV heparin.
#18 Code status
I discussed this at length with Mrs. Duran and her family members.  For now, she will be full code.  She will speak with her family members later.  She previously has been full code, although her last hospitalization she was DNR/DNI.  Her family is not sure if she fully understood what this meant.  This can be readdressed during this hospitalization.
ADDENDUM
TEE fortunately did not show evidence of any intracardiac thrombus or mass.  There was no mobile aortic atheroma or atrial shunt.  LVEF was 65%.  There was mild RV enlargement but normal RV function.
I met just after the TEE was completed at midnight with Mrs. Duran's family members and reviewed the results and our plan of care.  I greatly appreciate the expertise of Dr. Biggs in performing the TEE.

Fever, nausea, shortness-of-breath.

[end section id="20102"]

Mrs. Duran is a delightful 84-year-old female with a complex past medical history of chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday, Friday; diabetes mellitus type-2; diastolic heart failure; coronary artery disease; hypertension; history of prior DVT; and history of colon cancer with recurrence status-post bowel resection.  History was obtained from Mrs. Duran, her family members, Dr. Deborah Frampton, and the MFHNH medical record.
Briefly, Mrs. Duran was in her usual state of health until yesterday when she developed left upper quadrant pain.  This morning, while at dialysis, she had nausea, fevers, and chills.  Her temperature was elevated at 38.3.  Blood cultures were drawn and she was given a dose of Ancef 1.5 g.  Her blood pressure was stable; 1.3 L of fluid was drawn off.  She then returned to her assisted-living facility where she was reportedly found to be slumped over her wheelchair with oxygen saturations in the upper 80% range and systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  She was started on oxygen, and EMS was called; they found a systolic blood pressure of approximately 110 and brought Mrs. Duran to the Neola Family Dentistry Health Care Center.
In the Emergency Department, Mrs. Duran was noted initially to have decreased level of responsiveness, but when she was transferred from the gurney to the bed and repositioned, she was more alert, but she was only speaking in short sentences because of dyspnea.  Her temperature was elevated at 38.2.  She was noted to be hypoxemic, and she was started on supplemental oxygen at 4 L by nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray, which I reviewed, showed a patchy consolidation in the left lung base and a new small left pleural effusion with stable pulmonary venous hypertension.  Labs showed hemoglobin of 10.1 with an elevated MCV of 107.3.  WBC normal at 9.6.  Platelets somewhat low at 109.  Electrolytes were remarkable for a slightly low-potassium of 3.3 and a creatinine of 2.6 with a bicarb of 33.  Lactate was normal at 0.8.  Troponin was elevated at 0.08 times two; this has been noted previously.  Her NT-proBNP was significantly elevated at 32,511.  Amylase and lipase were unremarkable.  Glucose was 131.
Given concern for pneumonia, Mrs. Duran was empirically given vancomycin 2-g, cefepime 2-g, and Cipro 400-mg IV for treatment of presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia.  However, because Mrs. Duran also reported left upper quadrant pain/pleuritic pain, she underwent a chest CT angiogram and CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  Noted were pulmonary emboli within segmental pulmonary arteries of the right lower lobe and a new moderate-sized wedge-shaped splenic infarct.
I met with Mrs. Duran in the Emergency Department and had the privilege of meeting with Dr. Frampton.  I also met with Mrs. Duran's multiple family members.  Mrs. Duran was sitting up in her hospital gurney.  She was alert and awake.  She had nonlabored respirations, but she did have apparent conversational dyspnea.  She had a very rare nonproductive cough.  She was able to lie supine, which did not worsen or otherwise change her breathing.  She said her abdominal pain had resolved.  She said she was feeling much better than she had been earlier today.  I was able to wean down her oxygen to 1 L and she maintained her oxygen saturations in the low-to-mid-90s.
Because of the finding of pulmonary emboli in the splenic infarct, we elected to obtain bilateral lower-extremity ultrasound, which was negative for DVT.
On review of Mrs. Duran's medical record, she did undergo an attempt at thrombectomy of her left AV fistula on June 30, but this was unsuccessful.  She then had a right IJ tunneled dialysis catheter placed on July 1.  Left upper extremity graft ultrasound performed yesterday showed a small amount of thrombus in a segment of the graft that was not associated with significant stenosis, the left upper innominate subclavian and axillary veins were patent and negative for thrombus.
I did have the privilege of speaking with Vascular Medicine and our on-call echocardiographer.  At this time, we suspect the pulmonary emboli are a sequelae of the AV graft thrombectomy and are likely incidental and asymptomatic.  Given that there is no significant thrombus in the graft, no evidence of lower-extremity DVT, and likely Mrs. Duran is asymptomatic from the pulmonary emboli, our preference is to avoid anticoagulation if possible given her inherent increase in bleeding risk (risk factors of being on chronic hemodialysis and age).  However, we are unsure of the source of her splenic infarct.  She did undergo a prior TEE on October 31, 2001, that showed a closed foramen ovale so it would seem less likely that the splenic infarct could have resulted from any embolization of thrombus from her AV graft.  Our concern, however, is that she may have a valvular thrombus or aortic thrombus.
I subsequently met with Mrs. Duran after she had transferred to her hospital room.  She said "I feel much better than I did earlier today."  She had non-labored respirations.  I discussed our plans to perform a TEE.
