#1 Colonic stricture, suspected transverse colon
Dysplasia was noted.
#2 Polypoid lesion in the rectum with dysplasia
Discussed with Mrs. Myrick and her husband that likely she will need a total proctocolectomy with either end ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure because of the dysplasia and with her association with ulcerative colitis and the risk for malignancy.  I discussed with her that likely our surgeon will want to perform a short flexible sigmoidoscopy to look at the rectal area at the time of their exam.  We will get a CT enterography to rule-out Crohn's disease.  I discussed with her with her weight she may not be a candidate directly for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure and may end up needing an end ileostomy initially and then may need to lose weight before she may be a candidate for the IPAA.  I gave her an IPAA book, and I will have her meet with our stoma therapy nurses to discuss both the end ileostomy and the IPAA procedure.  Also, I discussed the differences between three-stage procedures versus two-stage procedures with her if she is a candidate for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure.  She denies fecal incontinence.  Answered multiple questions.  She will see Dr. Claas Hammack on Wednesday in surgical consultation.  I will scan in her outside colonoscopy, EGD reports, and pathology reports.  I discussed with her as with her stricture and her abdominal symptoms which are likely related to her stricture to stay on clear liquids primarily and very soft foods until her evaluation has been completed.  She has not vomited recently.  She had tried Zofran once which was not very effective for her.  I am thinking she likely is strictured for quite a ways beyond just the transverse colon as she had a mild stricture back in June 2009 of the hepatic flexure area.  Our CT-scan will likely help to identify this better.  I will discuss with Dr. Hammack whether further evaluation beside just proctoscopy or flex sig is needed of the rectal mass.  I do not know that she would be able to tolerate a full bowel prep very well with her stricture to perform an endoscopic rectal ultrasound.  No concerns at this point of PSC as her ERCP last fall was normal.  Also discussed there is a potential that there could be a malignancy in the colon.  At this point we do not have any evidence of this pathologically, but this is still a possibility.  I will get a screening CEA.
#3 Asthma
Currently this appears well-controlled.
#4 Cough
Will get a basic chest x-ray.  She does not appear to be having a significant flare, and it may just be a mild viral illness.
#5 Vitamin B12 deficiency
Stable.
#6 Obesity
Discussed the implications regarding surgery for her with her weight.
#7 PAME
Will get a basic EKG, chest x-ray, and basic blood work on her.
She was seen with her husband.  Sixty minutes spent.  All questions were answered.  I will see her back with Dr. Hammack on Wednesday.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
Code status:  Discussed with Mrs. Myrick.  She would like to be a full code.

Mrs. Myrick is a 53-year-old female from Elsberry, MO 63343 North Dakota, who has been referred by her gastroenterologist for the above indications.  Mrs. Myrick was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 1984.  Initially she was started on Azulfidine but ended up having a severe reaction with swelling and a rash and had to be hospitalized for two-weeks.  She was taking off this and was treated instead with steroids (low-dose) for approximately a six-year period.  However, it has been since 2002 since she has been on steroids for her ulcerative colitis.  She was managed by another gastroenterologist up until about a year ago who had been just having her take Darvocet for discomfort and had her use Flagyl when she would have flares which would help to decrease her diarrhea. She admits she does not want to be on chronic medication.  Back at that time she was moving her bowels 18 to 20 times a day and her stools were loose like water.  She was not having rectal bleeding, and no fecal incontinence.  These had been her symptoms up until she was started on Remicade approximately a year ago.  She had a colonoscopy on June 11, 2009, performed by Dr. Leslie Gresham, when he took over managing her care.  At that time she had a small smooth stricture in the hepatic flexure.  Biopsies were obtained although I do not have the outside pathology of these biopsies.  It appears in reviewing her outside reports that her biopsies were likely negative for dysplasia.  The exam was completed to the cecum.  With the terminal ileal exam, the mucosa was consistent with ulcerative colitis with diffuse erythema and superficial ulcerations.  Random biopsies were performed, and in reviewing the outside reports these did not reveal dysplasia, but I do not have the official pathology report.  She was then started on Remicade about every eight weeks, but more recently she has been getting it every six-weeks with her last dose on March 30, 2010. She noticed some improvement with the Remicade in that her bowels have slowed down to eight to ten times a day.  She is still having very watery stools and no bleeding.  She denies problems with fecal incontinence.  Of note, in the past has generally noticed the most improvement when she is on a short course of antibiotics such as Flagyl which she was treated with before.  She was treated with a week of Flagyl just three weeks ago.  She has had a significant change, however, in other symptoms in the last six-weeks.
For the last six-weeks she has been having severe nausea and vomiting.  For the last month she has not been vomiting as much as she has been trying to hold it back.  She vomited last about a week ago.  Generally she has been having problems with nausea.  Over the last two days she has developed pain in the right upper quadrant and lateral area.  This has been daily and rates a 4 to 5 on the pain scale.  When she takes Darvocet this will go down to a 2.  She cannot identify a specific pattern to it.  She has epigastric pain at times over the last six-weeks.  Her appetite has been decreasing, and she is a little bit afraid to eat and has been mostly staying on soft foods and liquids since her recent colonoscopy. With her new symptoms she had an EGD and colonoscopy performed on April 22, 2010.  An EGD  revealed a-1-cm hiatal hernia.  She had diffuse erythema in the gastric body and antrum.  A biopsy was performed and has been reviewed here revealing no intestinal metaplasia, mild chronic gastritis, and negative H. pylori.  It was recommended she start on PPI therapy, but as she does not like to take medication she has not started this.  She did not have heartburn or epigastric issues until the last six-weeks.  Her colonoscopy was only able to be performed to the distal transverse colon.  She had a very well-defined stricture in the area, and the scope could not be advanced.  Biopsies were obtained and reviewed here revealing low-grade columnar epithelial dysplasia in the background of mild active chronic colitis without granulomas or specific features.  The area was tattooed.  She also had a polypoid erythematous area in the proximal rectum that was biopsied with pathology here revealing low-grade columnar epithelial dysplasia.  It does not appear this area was removed, and the exact details are unclear. The prep was fair.  She has been referred for consideration of total proctocolectomy with possible ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedure.  She has not had other testing performed.
In regard to her weight, this has been stable over the last six-weeks, and she reports gaining quite a bit of weight when she was on steroids several years ago that she has never lost.  She is still moving her bowels multiple times a day.  She has been quite a bit more fatigued recently.  No family history of colorectal cancer.  There was some concern that she had primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in the past, but when she established with Dr. Leslie Gresham, an ERCP was performed on November 23, 2009, which was negative, revealing no evidence of strictures or ductal dilatation effectively ruling out PSC.  She apparently had a slightly elevated CA 19-9 that had been mildly elevated back in November at 40.  She had a history of acute pancreatitis suspected to be related to gallstones in the past and had a cholecystectomy in 1990.  It is mentioned per Dr. Leslie Gresham's note that she has likely bile salt diarrhea, and he had started her on Welchol one pill twice-daily.  This had helped to thicken her stools to an extent, but since she found about her colonoscopy results in April, she stopped the Welchol.  She has intermittently felt like she has had low-grade fevers and chills.  She checked her temperature, and it was 99.6 last week.
She developed a mild sore throat a few days ago and has a dry cough.  She does have a history of asthma but is not taking chronic medication for it and usually only is prescribed albuterol and antibiotics when she develops a flare of her respiratory symptoms.  This usually happens two-to-three times a year.  She had one short course of prednisone (Medrol Pak) in the last year which she took for her asthma.  No recent wheezing, shortness-of-breath, or worsening symptoms except for the occasional dry cough.  She does not generally feel that she is ill from the upper respiratory perspective at this time and just feels fatigued and nauseated from her other symptoms discussed above.
She also brings up she has an umbilical hernia, and if she is going to need surgery she would like to see if this can be repaired.
