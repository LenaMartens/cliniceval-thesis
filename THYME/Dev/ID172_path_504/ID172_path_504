Final Diagnosis
A.  Rectum, low anterior resection:  Residual moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified measuring 0.2 x 0.2 cm in association with an ulcer (3.2 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) located in the rectum, 1.6 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Tumor invades the submucosa.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (21) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC ypT2N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
