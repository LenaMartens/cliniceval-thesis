#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma (T4, N2, M0)
Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Tonda Mosley's Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Qjtsvymde Zxummra.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Jamie Woody, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
I have discussed with the patient that adjuvant chemotherapy is generally recommended in situations similar to this.  I have emphasized that a more complete plan of care will be more clearly delineated after an approximately four-week post-operative recovery period.
Mr. Blom has decided not to return in the outpatient setting for formal treatment evaluation, therefore, I will ask Dr. Woody to visit with Mr. Blom prior to dismissal for formal treatment recommendations.  I am not making follow-up return appointments but, certainly, if the need arises in the future, I am more than happy to help facility care.

I have been asked by Dr. Mosley's service to visit with Mr. Blom for postoperative education purposes.  Briefly, Mr. Blom is a pleasant 77 year-old male from New Jersey.
1.  May 2010 - Presented locally with a one-year history of anorexia, weight-loss, and a 50-pound weight-loss.  Hemoglobin 9.9.
2.  May 11, 2010 - Colonoscopy done locally noting a partially obstructing splenic flexure mass through which the scope was unable to pass. Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.
3.  May 28, 2010 - Presented to Kewanee.  CT imaging showing a 10-cm mass of the transverse colon, no evidence of distant disease.
4.  June 29, 2010 - Colonoscopy repeated identifying again approximately 10-cm colonic mass.  CEA 85.4.
5.  July 2, 2010 - Taken for en bloc resection of transverse colon, portion of descending colon, omentum, portion of the stomach, with ascending and descending colostomy by Dr. Mosley.  Per operative note, no evidence of distant disease but locally aggressive colon cancer identified.  Cancer forming grade 3-4 poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma forming 11.0 x 8.0 x 3.0 annular mass in the transverse colon perforating the visceral peritoneum and directly invading the gastric serosa and omentum.  Surgical resection margins negative.  Five of 23 regional lymph nodes positive for adenocarcinoma.
Mr. Blom is continuing to recover from surgery and is currently up sitting in bed during our consultation today.
