Reviewed outside endoscopy and pathology reports and radiology reports and lab data.  His ALT is mildly elevated at 49, and fatty liver disease is described on his CT-scan.  There are no focal hepatic nodules noted.
#1 Sigmoid colon cancer, question descending colon cancer
Mr. Kling is referred for further treatment of sigmoid colon cancer.  His pathology slides also describe cancer in a specimen from the descending colon, where two polyps measuring 2-mm and 4-mm were removed.  I suspect this may be contaminant; however, at this time we will proceed with a repeat colonoscopy to re-visualize the area.  The primary lesion in the sigmoid colon has been tattooed.  His outside CT will be sent to radiology for interpretation.  Laboratory studies including a CBC, chemistry panel, and also a lipid screen and PSA will be checked.  Given his history of hypertension and that he is not currently on medical therapy, we will check an six-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor and request hypertension evaluation is this is significantly abnormal.  I will also request an overnight oximetry for assessment of possible sleep apnea as this will affect his perioperative monitoring.  I will follow-up with the patient at the conclusion of his tests with colorectal surgery consultation.  Discussed the plan of care in detail with the patient and answered questions.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Chest x-ray, ECG, six-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor, and overnight oximetry are pending.  Once these are obtained and satisfactory, the patient is OK for anesthesia.
Discussed with Dr. Bobby Edwards; note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: Yes, on file at HHFI.

Mr. Kling is a 62-year-old gentleman who is referred for treatment of sigmoid colon cancer.  Mr. Kling had a four-month history of bright-red blood per rectum.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy March 23, 2010, was positive for a mass in the sigmoid.  He therefore underwent his first full colonoscopy March 25, 2010, which was positive for five lesions.  Two polyps measuring 3-mm and 6-mm were removed from the cecum (tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia) and two polyps were removed from the descending colon measuring 2-mm and 4-mm (invasive grade 3 [of 4] adenocarcinoma and fragment of mucosal prolapse polyp on pathology).  A 5-cm large fungating mass was noted in the sigmoid colon which was biopsied and then tattooed on the proximal and distal margin.  Pathology of this lesion was invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma as well, confirmed by Smith Medical Center.  CT abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the entire left colon from the splenic flexure to sigmoid.  CEA was 1.2 on March 25, 2010.  The patient presents now for evaluation and surgical recommendations.
Comorbidities include hypertension, previously treated with Hytrin.  He has been off medication now for some time.  There is no history of a heart attack or stroke, bleeding disorder, or anesthesia reaction thrombosis, or glaucoma.  There is a question of sleep apnea.  Apparently, he has had a sleep study, and one physician felt he had sleep apnea and the other felt he did not.  He does not currently use a CPAP.  He offers no other health complaints.
