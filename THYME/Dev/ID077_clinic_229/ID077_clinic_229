Mrs. Jordan is a 76-year-old female from Clayville, NY.  She had left hemicolectomy by Dr. Lee on May 13, 2008 for T2N0 sigmoid colon cancer.  She then had abdominal exploration, lysis of adhesions, and resection of previous anastomosis by Dr. Hedges on November 23, 2010.  Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was dismissed home on November 28, 2010.  The patient and her spouse contacted us today regarding her bowel movement.  She has not had one for the last three days.  She takes 1 cap of Colace twice-daily, is no longer on oxycodone, and has flatus.  She is otherwise doing well, denying abdominal pain, bloating, N/V, anorexia, fever, or signs of wound infection.  I recommended she take 15 ml of milk of magnesia today and repeat another dose tomorrow morning if she still has no bowel movements.  All questions were answered.  She agreed with the plan.  She was reached at 971-523-3939.
