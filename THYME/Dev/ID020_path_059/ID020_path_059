Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, sigmoid and rectum, resection:  Residual adenocarcinoma identified as rare scattered glands in the submucosa of a treatment associated ulcer in the rectum, 3.9 cm from the distal margin.  The margins of resection are negative for carcinoma.  Multiple (24) regional lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma.  Four of the regional lymph nodes show effacement by fibrosis consistent with treatment associated changes.

AJCC ypT1N0 

B.  Rectosigmoid, distal anastomotic ring, excision:  Unremarkable colonic mucosa identified grossly.  Gross examination only.

A 1.5 x 0.5 cm ulcer is present within the rectum, 3.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  Grossly, the ulcer is confined to the mucosa.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by PRICE
