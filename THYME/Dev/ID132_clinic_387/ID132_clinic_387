DATA
Discussed above.
IMPRESSION/PLAN
#1 Rectal cancer
Discussed in detail with Mr. Moore and his wife our evaluation of rectal cancer. This will include a CEA, chest x-ray, CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and endoscopic rectal ultrasound.  I will have his outside colonoscopy report scanned in.  I do not believe we need to repeat the colonoscopy here.  I discussed the potential for neoadjuvant therapy based on his staging and EUS results. He would like to obtain an opinion here by our medical and radiation oncology colleagues if neoadjuvant therapy is recommended.  I discussed there is a high likelihood that he may need either a permanent colostomy or a diverting ileostomy as this is quite a low tumor.  I will tentatively set-up Stoma Therapy to meet with him following Dr. Griffing' appointment.  Discussed with him to prep with an enema before he sees Dr. Griffing as Dr. Griffing will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy to evaluate the tumor.  Prep instructions reviewed.  Discussed his siblings should undergo screening colonoscopies starting at age 48 if they have not done so.  His children are adopted.
#2 Elevated PSA
This will need to be evaluated.  I will recheck a PSA and order a urology consult for further evaluation.  He has the family history with his father.
#3 Hyperlipidemia
Well-controlled.
#4 PAME
Will get a baseline EKG and blood work.  I will try to get his outside records in regard to his cardiac evaluation and procedure in 2001.
#5 Elevated glucose.
Will recheck screening glucose.
Spent 70 minutes with Mr. Moore and his wife.  Answered multiple questions.  All questions were answered.  I will see him back with Dr. Griffing on Friday.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.
Code status:  Discussed with the patient and his wife. He wants to be full code.

Mr. Moore is here at the request of Dr. Anderson for surgical evaluation for rectal cancer.

[end section id="20102"]

[start section id="20103"]

Mr. Moore is a 58-year-old male from Port Gibson Billerica, who experienced a single episode of rectal bleeding on the evening of February 16, 2010, following a loose bowel movement. He was scheduled to have his annual physical close to that time, and he asked to have his lab work performed the following morning at his local provider's office.  He was then seen in clinic, and due to his rectal bleeding it was decided to admit him to the local hospital.  He was not anemic at that time. They prepped him the following day for a colonoscopy which was his first colon screening and was performed to the cecum.  This revealed a "very large rectal cancer" close to the anal verge. Biopsies were performed with pathology slides reviewed here revealing invasive grade 3 of 4 adenocarcinoma.  The colonoscopy was also notable for sigmoid and descending colon diverticulosis.  He denies having diverticulitis. He has been off his 81-mg prophylactic aspirin since this episode.
Mr. Moore has not undergone staging studies.  He was seen locally, and it was discussed that he likely will need an abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy, and the possibility of neoadjuvant therapy was discussed.  He has decided, however, he would like an evaluation and surgery here.  He has no family history of colorectal cancer and has not had recent weight-loss.  He has not been more fatigued.  His bowel habits have changed over the last couple months in that he has noticed his stools have been more loose with occasional diarrhea.  Prior to two-months ago, he typically moved his bowels twice-a-day, and they were formed. He has not had additional bleeding since his episode on the 16th.  He denies fecal incontinence or hemorrhoid problems.  He denies rectal and abdominal pain.  He did not experience pain with the bleeding episode on the 16th.
Separately, he brings a copy of his lab work performed prior to his hospitalization on February 16.  This reveals an elevated PSA at 4.88 with the range at Veterans Affairs Sepulveda Ambulatory Hospital being 0 to 4.  He also brings his lab work from the prior year.  On January 7, 2009, his PSA was 2.32.  He has a family history of prostate cancer in his father who developed this at age 72 and underwent a radical prostatectomy.  There was a question about the surgical margins and approximately 10 to 12 years later he had to undergo external-beam radiation therapy and now is doing well.  Mr. Moore believes his PSAs for the last several years since age 50 have been normal.  He denies hematuria, nocturia, or urinary incontinence.  There was a time approximately six to eight months ago when he was having difficulty obtaining an erection which lasted three-to-four months, and he was given a Viagra.  This ended up resolving spontaneously, and he has been doing well currently and never used the Viagra.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1.  Hyperlipidemia.  He has been on medication for several years.  His recent cholesterol panel from February 16th revealed a total cholesterol of 177, triglycerides of 80, HDL 48, and an LDL of 113.  He is on fish oil.
2.  Prior history of asthma. When he was a child he had severe asthma, but is no longer using an inhaler and he denies respiratory symptoms.
3.  Pericardial effusion, unclear etiology. In 2001 he developed a severe upper respiratory infection thought to be bronchitis and became quite short of breath.  His chest x-ray revealed a significant pericardial effusion.  He underwent minor surgery, a pericardial window it sounds like (I do not have these records), and the fluid was drained.  He had a follow-up echocardiogram which was normal. He was instructed should he ever develop a significant respiratory infection again that he should have a chest x-ray to make sure he does not have a recurrence. He does not remember the term endocarditis being used.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
1.  He broke his ankle in the eighth grade and was casted.
2.  Pericardial window as discussed above in 2001.
3.  He had an injury and fractured his left elbow and left wrist and was casted.
