INVESTIGATIONS
Outside CT-scan of 2 March 2010 of the chest showed small attenuation lesions in both lobes of thyroid gland.  This could represent adenomas.  Also, there was a 4-cm area of low-attenuation in the anterior aspect of the dome of hepatic lobe.  This did not persist on delayed images and possibly represented a perfusion abnormality.
The MR abdomen and pelvis from 4 March suggested circumferential infiltrating masses of the rectum with direct extension to the perirectal fat plane on the right with associated perirectal adenopathy.  The lesion abutted mesorectal fascia, and diffuse thickening of mesorectal fascia was noted with extension to the right seminal vesicle with thinking of Denonvilliers fascia.  No gross invasion into the prostate was noted.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis originally in October of 2009 was again suggestive of marked thickening of the rectum compatible with rectal carcinoma with associated perirectal lymphadenopathy with largest measuring 1.6-cm.  There was also a 7-mm enhancing lesion involving the lateral segment of the left lobe, and this was suggestive of a hemangioma.
An ultrasound of the liver showed that this 0.7-cm enhancing lesion on CT in the left hepatic lobe was likely a cavernous hemangioma, or less likely an FNH (focal nodular hyperplasia).
IMPRESSION
#1 Rectal cancer in the setting of FAP (proband)  status-post total proctocolectomy with en bloc resection of rectum and anus
#2 Possibility of thyroid adenomas as suggested on CT-scan in the setting of FAP, rule-out thyroid cancer
#3 Reported intra-abdominal thrombosis
Was on anticoagulation until recently.  Currently, anticoagulation on hold in light of recent surgery.
PLAN
At this time, I do not have access to all of his outside medical records; however, from oncologic standpoint  after at least 4 weeks of rest we would recommend initiation of FOLFOX therapy for a total of eight cycles.  He has had an excellent response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy as the nodes were negative on biopsy; however, based on the previous radiographic findings with evidence of bulky lymphadenopathy it is highly likely he had node-positive disease which became node-negative as a result of response to chemoradiation therapy.  He is already under care of an oncologist in Minnesota and would like to receive chemotherapy closer to home. He should have another postoperative CEA and  baseline CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis  in about four weeks prior to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.
On path report only 80 polyps were found. It is possible this is attenuated FAP.
We would suggest getting an endocrinology consultation with a possible ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid gland to rule-out evidence of malignancy.  He states that he has had a PET scan in November.  I do not see the PET scan films loaded  in our electronic  system.  Please get these uploaded so that we have an official PET scan reading too from our radiologists.  We would also like to know if there is any increased uptake in the thyroid region.
Due to his reported diagnosis FAP (proband), he is at additional risk for extracolonic manifestations such as thyroid cancers, duodenal, gastric cancers/polyps, desmoid tumors, etc.  I have discussed this extensively with him, and the need to get a baseline upper endoscopy for direct visualization of gastric and duodenal mucosa. Subsequent surveillance endoscopy would be dependent on the findings at the time of first upper endoscopy.  For small-bowel visualization capsule endoscopy could be  used.
Please get all relevant outside medical records scanned in our system, including the APC gene mutation report as his site of APC mutation could  have a bearing on certain extracolonic manifestations.
I have also shared with him some guidelines for management of familial adenomatous polyposis and have given a paper by Vassin et al (Gut/2008; 704-713).  The case was discussed extensively with Dr. Frantz

Mr. Childs Brown is a very pleasant 29-year-old gentleman who was unfortunately diagnosed recently with rectal cancer in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).  His symptoms began in October 2009 when he started to experience constipation and a feeling of incomplete evacuation.  At that time, he also experienced rectal pressure/fullness and occasionally had hematochezia.  His symptoms started two-to-three weeks prior to presentation to his local MD.  In addition, he has had a weight-loss of about 15 pounds, particularly when he transitioned to liquid diet, with the hope that his symptoms would get resolved with dietary modifications.  He denies any fever, chills, loss of appetite, chest pain, shortness-of-breath, bone pain, or headaches.  He denies any neurological symptoms.  He does not have any family history of colon cancer . He states that he was diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis/FAP with genetic testing; and one of his siblings (brother) was also tested.  However, his brother did not have any abnormality in APC gene mutation.  His CT-scan  on October 18, 2009, showed an extensive rectal  tumor with external iliac adenopathy along with bulky lymphadenopathy in the pelvis.  He had a colonoscopy (per Dr. Nicole Davis's note on October 26), and a rectal mass with 75% circumferential involvement extending at least 5-cm into the rectum was noted.  There were at least a 100 polyps.  His CEA in November was 2.3.
He underwent loop ileostomy on November 27, 2009.  Then, in early December he was started on radiation with concurrent chemotherapy (Xeloda) which he received through January 23, 2010.  He received a total of 5400 cGy to the rectal tumor.
He was initially evaluated by Dr. Nicole Davis on February 10, 2010.  A plan for surgery with intraoperative radiation therapy was made at that time.
On March 23, 2010, he underwent total proctocolectomy with combined en bloc resection of rectum, anus, portion of seminal vesicles on the right-side, plus Denonvilliers fascia with a complex excision of the left external iliac lymph gland, and takedown loop ileostomy with ileoileostomy (end-to-end along with bilateral ureteral stent placement and intraoperative radiation therapy),  and 1000 cGy of IORT
The biopsy showed microscopic focus of residual moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within fibrous tissue, associated with extensive mucin pools.  The margins were free of tumor.  In addition, vas deferens, right seminal vesicle, prostate anterior margin was free of any tumor cells.  His left external iliac lymph node biopsy was suggestive of fibrosis and necrosis.  There were multiple tubular (80) adenomata with low-grade dysplasia identified with six regional lymph nodes that were negative for tumor.  In addition, two ileocolic lymph nodes were also negative for tumor.
Medical Oncology was consulted for further recommendations regarding chemotherapy.

Denies any history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.  No other significant past medical history other than that stated in HPI.  Particularly, he did not undergo colonoscopy until recently in October of 2009, since there were no symptoms or any family history of FAP.  He states that he had some intraabdominal"blood clots."  I do not have the medical records from his hometown to verify this, but he states that he was on Coumadin until last week and was transitioned to Lovenox in anticipation of the planned surgery.
