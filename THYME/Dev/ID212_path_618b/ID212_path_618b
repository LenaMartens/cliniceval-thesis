Final Diagnosis
A.  Sigmoid colon and rectum, resection:  Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma, forming a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm mass within the muscularis propria and perirectal fat of the rectum.  The tumor extends to within 2 mm of the anterior lateral radial resection margin.  The tumor is 2.0 cm proximal to the dentate line. Biopsy site changes and focal ulceration are also identified in vicinity to the tumor. Multiple (4 of 16) regional lymph nodes are positive for adenocarcinoma.  

B.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Unremarkable segment of sigmoid colon.  Multiple (10) regional lymph nodes are negative for neoplasm.

C.  Vaginal wall, posterior, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.

D.  Uterus, hysterectomy:  The cervix is without diagnostic abnormality.  Secretory endometrium.  Myometrium with adenomyosis.  

E.  Fallopian tubes and ovaries, bilateral, oophorectomy and salpingectomy:  Adult granulosa cell tumor forming a mass, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm is identified in the left ovary.  The rightand left fallopian tubes and the right ovary are without diagnostic abnormality.

Seen in consultation with Dr. Emmy Herman (by telepathology).

Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on paraffin sections of the left ovary using antibodies directed against the following antigens: Inhibin, EMA. The neoplastic cells are positive for inhibin and negative for EMA supporting above diagnosis.

F.  Vaginal wall, posterior, excision:  Negative for tumor.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""anus, rectum, portion sigmoid"" is an abdominal perineal resection specimen consisting of 16.0 cm in length portion of rectosigmoid colon with a 7.5 x 1.6 cm portion of anus.  The radial margin is inked and submitted perpendicularly.  A 2.9 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm lesion is present within the rectum, at the dentate line, 2.8 cm from the skin margin.  Grossly, the lesion extends into the muscle.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Photograph taken.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by MILLER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""portion of sigmoid"" is a 15.0 cm portion of unremarkable colon.  Lymph nodes are identified with in the pericolonic fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CORREA.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""posterior vaginal wall (blue dye toward rectum)"" are two portions of pink-red soft to fibrous tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 3.2 x 2.1 x 0.9 cm.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by MILLER.

D.  Received fresh labeled ""uterus"" is a 195.0 gram uterus without attached bilateral tubes and ovaries and cervix.  The uterine serosa is smooth.  The endometrium is unremarkable.  There are multiple (7) intramural leiomyomata (ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 1.2 cm) and multiple (10) submucosal nodules ranging from 0.3 cm to 2.0 cm.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by CARTER.

E.  Received fresh labeled ""bilateral tubes and ovaries"" is a 25.0 gram, 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm left ovary with 8.0 x 0.7 cm left fallopian tube.  The ovary has a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface.  There is a 2.5 x 2.5 cm tan-yellow well-circumscribed nodule. The fallopian tube is unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by CARTER.

F.  Received fresh labeled additional posterior vaginal wall is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm portion of pink-tan soft tissue with orientation.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by CARTER.
